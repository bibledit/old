<p>translate("With Bibledit several translators can work on one Bible at the same time.")</p>
<p>translate("There is nothing special needed to make this happen.")</p>
<p>translate("The people log into the site that runs Bibledit, and translate there.")</p>

<h1>translate("Distributed collaboration")</h1>
<p>translate("With distributed collaboration there are several copies of the Bible distributed all over the place or the globe.")</p>
<p>translate("Translators and other people that collaborate in this way do not need to be connected to the Internet all the time, or even not at all.")</p>
<p>translate("They collaborate through the network or a USB drive.")</p>
<p>translate("Once everything has been set up, it all goes automatic. The person working on the Bible does not notice the mechanics of the collaboration. It all happens under the hood.")</p>
<p>translate("There are a variety of methods for collaboration. The administrator who will set it all up needs to have sufficient knowledge of information technology.")</p>
<p>translate("Bibledit stores all data locally. When collaboration is enabled, it also connects to a central repository. Through that repository the data gets shared between the various translators and other users.")</p>
<p>translate("Under the hood, Bibledit uses Git for collaboration. Git is a content manager. The user does not notice that Git is used. He does not operate it directly. The only thing that the manager needs to do at regular times is to 'Send/Receive' the Bible. After having done that, the changes in the Bible, made by the other translators or users, appear on his screen too. And the changes made by himself get stored in the repository, and if the other users do Send/Receive also, then these changes will reflect on their screens also.")</p>

  translate("Git uses a "git" repository to store the entire history of the Bible translation.")
  translate("The web interface of a modern git repository like github.com makes it easy to go through the history of the project.")
  translate("There are also desktop programs for browsing the history of a local git repository.")
  translate("Bibledit itself does not provide a historic overview of the changes in the Bible, because there are enough alternatives to obtain that information.")
