\v 1 Titus, you must teach only what is correct.
\v 2 Tell the older men to have self-control and to be serious and sensible. Their faith, love, and patience must never fail.
\p
\v 3 Tell the older women to behave as those who love the Lord should. They must not gossip about others or be slaves of wine. They must teach what is proper,
\v 4 so the younger women will be loving wives and mothers.
\v 5 Each of the younger women must be sensible and kind, as well as a good homemaker, who puts her own husband first. Then no one can say insulting things about God's message.
\p
\v 6 Tell the young men to have self-control in everything.

\p
\v 9 Tell slaves always to please their owners by obeying them in everything. Slaves must not talk back to their owners
