\c 22
\q1
\v 1 A slothful man is compared to a stone that is defiled;
\q1 And every one will hiss him out in his disgrace.
\q1
\v 2 A slothful man is compared to the filth of a dunghill:
\q1 Every man that takes it up will shake out his hand.
\b
\q1
\v 3 A father has shame in having begotten an uninstructed \add son;\add*
\q1 And a \add foolish \add* daughter is born to his loss.
\q1
\v 4 A prudent daughter will inherit a husband of her own;
\q1 And she that brings shame is the grief of her father.
\q1
\v 5 She that is bold brings shame upon father and husband;
\q1 And she will be despised of them both.
\q1
\v 6 Unseasonable discourse is \add as \add* music in mourning;
\q1 But stripes and correction are wisdom at every season.
\b
\q1
\v 7 He that teaches a fool is \add as \add* one that glues a potsherd together;
\q1 \add Even as \add* one that wakes a sleeper out of a deep sleep.
\q1
\v 8 He who teaches a fool is \add as \add* one who teaches a man who slumbers;
\q1 And at the end he will say, What is it?
\v 9-10 \f + \fr 22:9-10 \ft Verses 9 and 10 are omitted by the best authorities.\f*
\q1
\v 11 Weep for the dead, for light has failed \add him; \add*
\q1 And weep for a fool, for understanding has failed \add him: \add*
\q1 Weep more sweetly for the dead, because he has found rest;
\q1 But the life of the fool is worse than death.
\q1
\v 12 Seven days are \add the days of \add* mourning for the dead;
\q1 But for a fool and an ungodly man, all the days of his life.
\b
\q1
\v 13 Talk not much with a foolish man,
\q1 And go not to one that has no understanding:
\q1 Beware of him, lest you have trouble;
\q1 And \add so \add* you shall not be \f + \fr 22:13 \ft Or, \fqa defiled: in his onslaught turn\f* defiled in his onslaught:
\q1 Turn away from him, and you will find rest;
\q1 And \add so \add* you shall not be wearied in his madness.
\q1
\v 14 What shall be heavier than lead?
\q1 And what is the name thereof, but a fool?
\q1
\v 15 Sand, and salt, and a mass of iron, is easier to bear,
\q1 Than a man without understanding.
\b
\q1
\v 16 Timber girded and bound into a building will not be released with shaking:
\q1 So a heart established in due season on well advised counsel will not be afraid.
\q1
\v 17 A heart settled upon a thoughtful understanding
\q1 Is as an ornament of plaster on a polished wall.
\q1
\v 18 Pales set on a high place will not stand against the wind:
\q1 So a fearful heart in the imagination of a fool will not stand against any fear.
\b
\q1
\v 19 He that pricks the eye will make tears to fall;
\q1 And he that pricks the heart makes it to show feeling.
\q1
\v 20 Whoso casts a stone at birds frays them away;
\q1 And he that upbraids a friend will dissolve friendship.
\q1
\v 21 If you have drawn a sword against a friend, despair not;
\q1 For there may be a returning.
\q1
\v 22 If you have opened your mouth against a friend, fear not;
\q1 For there may be a reconciling;
\q1 Except it be for upbraiding, and arrogance, and disclosing of a secret, and a treacherous blow:
\q1 For these things every friend will flee.
\b
\q1
\v 23 Gain trust with your neighbor in his poverty,
\q1 That in his prosperity you may have gladness:
\q1 Stay steadfast to him in the time of his affliction,
\q1 That you may be heir with him in his inheritance. \f + \fr 22:23\ft The remainder of this verse is omitted by the best authorities.\f*
\q1
\v 24 Before fire is the vapor and smoke of a furnace;
\q1 So revilings before bloodshed.
\q1
\v 25 I will not be ashamed to shelter a friend;
\q1 And I will not hide myself from his face:
\q1
\v 26 And if any evil happen to me because of him,
\q1 Every one that hears it will beware of him.
\b
\q1
\v 27 Who shall set a watch over my mouth,
\q1 And a seal of shrewdness upon my lips,
\q1 That I fall not from it, and that my tongue destroy me not?
