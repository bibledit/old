\c 34
\q1
\v 1 Vain and false hopes are for a man void of understanding;
\q1 And dreams give wings to fools.
\q1
\v 2 As one that catches at a shadow, and follows after the wind,
\q1 So is he that sets his mind on dreams.
\q1
\v 3 The vision of dreams is \add as \add* this thing against that,
\q1 The likeness of a face near a face.
\q1
\v 4 Of an unclean thing what shall be cleansed?
\q1 And of that which is false what shall be true?
\q1
\v 5 Divinations, and soothsayings, and dreams, are vain:
\q1 And the heart fancies, as a woman’s in travail.
\q1
\v 6 If they be not sent from the Most High in \add your \add* visitation,
\q1 Give not your heart to them.
\v 7 For dreams have led many astray:
\q1 And they have failed by putting their hope in them.
\q1
\v 8 Without lying shall the law be accomplished;
\q1 And wisdom is perfection to a faithful mouth.
\b
\q1
\v 9 A well-instructed man knows many things;
\q1 And he that has much experience will declare understanding.
\q1
\v 10 He that has no experience knows few things:
\q1 But he that has wandered shall increase \add his \add* skill.
\q1
\v 11 In my wandering I have seen many things;
\q1 And more than my words is my understanding.
\q1
\v 12 Ofttimes was I in danger even to death;
\q1 And I was preserved because of these things.
\q1
\v 13 The spirit of those that fear the Lord shall live;
\q1 For their hope is upon him that saves them.
\q1
\v 14 Whoso fears the Lord shall not be afraid, and shall not play the coward;
\q1 For he is his hope.
\q1
\v 15 Blessed is the soul of him that fears the Lord:
\q1 To whom does he give heed? and who is his stay?
\q1
\v 16 The eyes of the Lord are upon those who love him,
\q1 A mighty protection and strong stay,
\q1 A cover from the hot blast, and a cover from the noonday,
\q1 A guard from stumbling, and a help from falling.
\q1
\v 17 He raises up the soul, and enlightens the eyes:
\q1 He gives healing, life, and blessing.
\b
\q1
\v 18 He that sacrifices of a thing wrongfully gotten, his offering is made in mockery;
\q1 And the mockeries of wicked men are not well-pleasing.
\q1
\v 19 The Most High has no pleasure in the offerings of the ungodly;
\q1 Neither is he pacified for sins by the multitude of sacrifices.
\q1
\v 20 \add As \add* one that kills the son before his father’s eyes
\q1 Is he that brings a sacrifice from the goods of the poor.
\q1
\v 21 The bread of the needy is the life of the poor:
\q1 He that deprives him thereof is a man of blood.
\q1
\v 22 \add As \add* one that slays his neighbor is he that takes away his living;
\q1 And \add as \add* a shedder of blood is he that deprives a hireling of his hire.
\q1
\v 23 One building, and another pulling down,
\q1 What profit have they had but toil?
\q1
\v 24 One praying, and another cursing,
\q1 Whose voice will the Lord listen to?
\q1
\v 25 He that washes himself after \add touching \add* a dead body, and touches it again,
\q1 What profit has he in his washing?
\q1
\v 26 Even so a man fasting for his sins,
\q1 And going again, and doing the same;
\q1 Who will listen to his prayer?
\q1 And what profit has he in his humiliation?
\b
