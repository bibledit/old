\q1
\v 1 Don’t contend with a mighty man,
\q2 lest perhaps you fall into his hands.

\q2 and how to minister to great men.
\q1
\v 9 Don’t miss the discourse of the aged,

\v 12 Don’t lend to a man who is mightier than yourself;
\q2 and if you lend, be as one who has lost.
\q1
\v 13 Don’t be surety above your power.
\q2 If you are surety, think as one who will have to pay.
\b
\q1

\q2 for according to his honor they will give judgement for him.
\q1

\q2 lest he be burdonsome to you;
\q2 for he will do according to his own will,
\q2 and you will perish with his folly.
\q1
\v 16 Don’t fight with a wrathful man.
\q2 Don’t travel with him through the desert,
\q2 for blood is as nothing in his sight.
\q2 Where there is no help, he will overthrow you.
\q1
\v 17 Don’t take counsel with a fool,
\q2 for he will not be able to conceal the matter.

\q2 For you don’t know what it will cause.
\q1
\v 19 Don’t open your heart to every man.
\q2 Don’t let him return you a favor.
\b
