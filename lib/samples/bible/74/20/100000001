\c 20
\q1
\v 1 There is a reproof that is not comely;
\q1 And there is a man that keeps silence, and he is wise.
\q1
\v 2 How good is it to reprove, rather than to be angry;
\q1 And he that makes confession will be kept back from hurt.
\v 3 \f + \fr 20:3 \ft Verse 3 is omitted by the best authorities.\f*
\q1
\v 4 As is the lust of an eunuch to deflower a virgin;
\q1 So is he that executes judgments with violence.
\q1
\v 5 There is one that keeps silence, and is found wise;
\q1 And there is one that is hated for his much talk.
\q1
\v 6 There is one that keeps silence, for he has no answer to make;
\q1 And there is that keeps silence, as knowing his time.
\q1
\v 7 A wise man will be silent till his time come;
\q1 But the braggart and fool will overpass his time.
\q1
\v 8 He that uses many words will be abhorred;
\q1 And he that takes to himself authority therein will be hated.
\b
\q1
\v 9 There is a prosperity that a man finds in misfortunes;
\q1 And there is a gain that turns to loss.
\q1
\v 10 There is a gift that will not profit you;
\q1 And there is a gift whose recompense is double.
\q1
\v 11 There is an abasement because of glory;
\q1 And there is that has lifted up his head from a low estate.
\q1
\v 12 There is that buys much for a little,
\q1 And pays for it again sevenfold.
\q1
\v 13 He that is wise in words will make himself beloved;
\q1 But the pleasantries of fools will be wasted.
\q1
\v 14 The gift of a fool will not profit you;\f + \fr 20:14 \ft A line of this verse is here omitted by the best authorities.\f*
\q1 For his eyes are many instead of one.
\q1
\v 15 He will give little, and upbraid much;
\q1 And he will open his mouth like a crier:
\q1 Today he will lend, and tomorrow he will ask it again:
\q1 Such an one is a hateful man.
\q1
\v 16 The fool will say, I have no friend,
\q1 And I have no thanks for my good deeds;
\q1 They that eat my bread are of evil tongue.
\q1
\v 17 How often, and of how many, will he be laughed to scorn! \f + \fr 20:17\ft The latter part of verse 17 is omitted by the best authorities.\f*
\b
\q1
\v 18 A slip on a pavement is better than \add a slip \add* with the tongue;
\q1 So the fall of the wicked will come speedily.
\q1
\v 19 A man without grace is \add as \add* a tale out of season:
\q1 It will be continually in the mouth of the ignorant.
\q1
\v 20 A \f + \fr 20:20 \ft Gr. \fqa parable. \f* wise sentence from a fool’s mouth will be rejected;
\q1 For he will not speak it in its season.
\b
\q1
\v 21 There is that is hindered from sinning through lack;
\q1 And when he takes rest, he will not be troubled.
\q1
\v 22 There is that destroys his soul through bashfulness;
\q1 And by a foolish countenance he will destroy it.
\q1
\v 23 There is that for bashfulness promises to his friend;
\q1 And he makes him his enemy for nothing.
\b
\q1
\v 24 A lie is a foul blot in a man:
\q1 It will be continually in the mouth of the ignorant.
\q1
\v 25 A thief is better than a man that is continually lying:
\q1 But they both will inherit destruction.
\q1
\v 26 The disposition of a liar is dishonor;
\q1 And his shame is with him continually.
\b
\q1
\v 27 He that is wise in words will advance himself;
\q1 And one that is prudent will please great men.
\q1
\v 28 He that tils his land will raise his heap high;
\q1 And he that pleases great men will get pardon for iniquity.
\q1
\v 29 Presents and gifts blind the eyes of the wise,
\q1 And as a muzzle on the mouth, turn away reproofs.
\q1
\v 30 Wisdom that is hid, and treasure that is out of sight,
\q1 What profit is in them both?
\q1
\v 31 Better is a man that hides his folly
\q1 Than a man that hides his wisdom.
\v 32 \f + \fr 20:32 \ft Verse 32 is omitted by the best authorities.\f*
