\v 1 \x + \xo 9:1 \xt Ezra 10:6\x* Then Esdras rising from the court of the temple went to the chamber of Jonas the son of Eliasib,
\v 2 and lodged there, and did eat no bread nor drink water, mourning for the great iniquities of the multitude.
\v 3 And there was made proclamation in all Jewry and Jerusalem to all those who were of the captivity, that they should be gathered together at Jerusalem:
\v 4 and that whoever met not there within two or three days, according as the elders that bare rule appointed, their cattle should be seized to the use of the temple, and himself cast out from the multitude of those who were of the captivity.
\p
\v 5 And in three days were all they of the tribe of Judah and Benjamin gathered together at Jerusalem: this was the ninth month, on the twentieth day of the month.
\v 6 And all the multitude sat together trembling in the broad place before the temple because of the present foul weather.
\v 7 So Esdras arose up and said to them, you° have transgressed the law and married strange wives to increase the sins of Israel.
\v 8 And now make confession and give glory to the Lord, the God of our fathers,
\v 9 and do his will, and separate yourselves from the heathen of the land, and from the strange women.
\v 10 Then cried the whole multitude, and said with a loud voice, Just as you have spoken, so will we do.
\v 11 But forasmuch as the multitude is great, and it is foul weather, so that we can’t stand without, and this is not a work of one day or two, seeing our sin in these things is spread far:
\v 12 therefore let the rulers of the multitude stay, and let all them of our habitations that have strange wives come at the time appointed,
\v 13 and with them the rulers and judges of every place, till we turn away the wrath of the Lord from us for this matter.

\p
\v 38 \x + \xo 9:38 \xt Nehemiah 8:1\x* And the whole multitude were gathered together with one accord into the broad place before the porch of the temple toward the east:
\v 39 and they said to Esdras the priest and reader, Bring the law of Moses, that was given of the Lord, the God of Israel.
\v 40 So Esdras the chief priest brought the law to the whole multitude both of men and women, and to all the priests, to hear the law on the new moon of the seventh month.
\v 41 And he read in the broad place before the porch of the temple from morning to mid-day, before both men and women; and\f + \fr 9:41 \ft Another reading is, \fqa they gave all heed.\f* all the multitude gave heed to the law.
\v 42 And Esdras the priest and reader of the law stood up upon the pulpit of wood, which was made\add for that purpose. \add*
\v 43 And there stood up by him Mattathias, Sammus, Ananias, Azarias, Urias,\f + \fr 9:43 \fqa Hilkiah.\f* Ezekias, Baalsamus, upon the right hand:
\v 44 and upon his left hand, \f + \fr 9:44 \fqa Pedaiah.\f* Phaldeus, Misael, Melchias,\f + \fr 9:44 \fqa Hashuin.\f* Lothasubus, Nabarias, Zacharias.
\v 45 Then took Esdras the book of the law before the multitude, and sat honorably in the first place before all.
\v 46 And when he opened the law, they stood all straight up. So Esdras blessed the Lord God Most High, the God of armies, Almighty.
\v 47 And all the people answered, Amen; and lifting up their hands they fell to the ground, and worshiped the Lord.
\v 48 Also Jesus, Annus, Sarabias, Iadinus, Jacubus, Sabateus, \f + \fr 9:48\fqa Hodiah.\f* Auteas, Maiannas, and Calitas, Azarias, and Jozabdus, and Ananias, Phalias, the Levites, taught the law of the Lord, \f + \fr 9:48 \ft Some authorities omit \fq and read...Lord.\f* and read to the multitude the law of the Lord, making them withal to understand it.
\v 49 Then said Attharates to Esdras the chief priest and reader, and to the Levites that taught the multitude, even to all,
\v 50 This day is holy to the Lord; (now they all wept when they heard the law:)
\v 51 go then, and eat the fat, and drink the sweet, and send portions to those who have nothing;
\v 52 for the day is holy to the Lord: and be not sorrowful; for the Lord will bring you to honor.
\v 53 So the Levites published all things to the people, saying, This day is holy; be not sorrowful.
\v 54 Then they went their way, every one to eat and drink, and make merry, and to give portions to those who had nothing, and to make great cheer;
\v 55 because they \f + \fr 9:55 \ft Or, \fqa were inspired by\f* understood the words wherein they were instructed, and for the which they had been assembled.
