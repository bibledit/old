\v 17 Now I beg you, brothers, look out for those who are causing the divisions and occasions of stumbling, contrary to the doctrine which you learned, and turn away from them.
\v 18 For those who are such don’t serve our Lord, Jesus Christ, but their own belly; and by their smooth and flattering speech, they deceive the hearts of the innocent.
\v 19 For your obedience has become known to all. I rejoice therefore over you. But I desire to have you wise in that which is good, but innocent in that which is evil.
\v 20 And the God of peace will quickly crush Satan under your feet.
\p The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.

\v 24 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all! Amen.
\v 25  \f + \fr 16:25  \ft TR places Romans 14:24-26 at the end of Romans instead of at the end of chapter 14, and numbers these verses 16:25-27.\f*
