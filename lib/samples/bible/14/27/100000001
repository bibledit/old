\v 1 Jotham was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Jerushah the daughter of Zadok.
\v 2 He did that which was right in Yahweh’s eyes, according to all that his father Uzziah had done. However he didn’t enter into Yahweh’s temple. The people still acted corruptly.
\v 3 He built the upper gate of Yahweh’s house, and he built much on the wall of Ophel.
\v 4 Moreover he built cities in the hill country of Judah, and in the forests he built fortresses and towers.
\v 5 He also fought with the king of the children of Ammon, and prevailed against them. The children of Ammon gave him the same year one hundred talents\f + \fr 27:5  \ft A talent is about 30 kilograms or 66 pounds\f* of silver, ten thousand cors\f + \fr 27:5  \ft 1 cor is the same as a homer, or about 55.9 U.

\v 6 So Jotham became mighty, because he ordered his ways before Yahweh his God.
\v 7 Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all his wars, and his ways, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah.
\v 8 He was five and twenty years old when he began to reign, and reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem.
\v 9 Jotham slept with his fathers, and they buried him in David’s city; and Ahaz his son reigned in his place.
