\c 11
\d For the Chief Musician. By David.
\q1
\v 1 In Yahweh, I take refuge.
\q2 How can you say to my soul, “Flee as a bird to your mountain!”
\q1
\v 2 For, behold, the wicked bend their bows.
\q2 They set their arrows on the strings,
\q2 that they may shoot in darkness at the upright in heart.
\q1
\v 3 If the foundations are destroyed,
\q2 what can the righteous do?
\q1
\v 4 Yahweh is in his holy temple.
\q2 Yahweh is on his throne in heaven.
\q1 His eyes observe.
\q2 His eyes examine the children of men.
\q1
\v 5 Yahweh examines the righteous,
\q2 but the wicked and him who loves violence his soul hates.
\q1
\v 6 On the wicked he will rain blazing coals;
\q2 fire, sulfur, and scorching wind shall be the portion of their cup.
\q1
\v 7 For Yahweh is righteous.
\q2 He loves righteousness.
\q2 The upright shall see his face.
