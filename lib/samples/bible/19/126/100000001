\c 126
\d A Song of Ascents.
\q1
\v 1 When Yahweh brought back those who returned to Zion,
\q2 we were like those who dream.
\q1
\v 2 Then our mouth was filled with laughter,
\q2 and our tongue with singing.
\q1 Then they said among the nations,
\q2 “Yahweh has done great things for them.”
\q1
\v 3 Yahweh has done great things for us,
\q2 and we are glad.
\q1
\v 4 Restore our fortunes again, Yahweh,
\q2 like the streams in the Negev.
\q1
\v 5 Those who sow in tears will reap in joy.
\q2
\v 6 He who goes out weeping, carrying seed for sowing,
\q2 will certainly come again with joy, carrying his sheaves.
