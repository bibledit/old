\c 123
\d A Song of Ascents.
\q1
\v 1 To you I do lift up my eyes,
\q2 you who sit in the heavens.
\q1
\v 2 Behold, as the eyes of servants look to the hand of their master,
\q2 as the eyes of a maid to the hand of her mistress;
\q2 so our eyes look to Yahweh, our God,
\q2 until he has mercy on us.
\q1
\v 3 Have mercy on us, Yahweh, have mercy on us,
\q2 for we have endured much contempt.
\q1
\v 4 Our soul is exceedingly filled with the scoffing of those who are at ease,
\q2 with the contempt of the proud.
