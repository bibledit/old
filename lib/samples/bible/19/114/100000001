\c 114
\q1
\v 1 When Israel went out of Egypt,
\q2 the house of Jacob from a people of foreign language,
\q1
\v 2 Judah became his sanctuary,
\q2 Israel his dominion.
\q1
\v 3 The sea saw it, and fled.
\q2 The Jordan was driven back.
\q1
\v 4 The mountains skipped like rams,
\q2 the little hills like lambs.
\q1
\v 5 What was it, you sea, that you fled?
\q2 You Jordan, that you turned back?
\q1
\v 6 You mountains, that you skipped like rams;
\q2 you little hills, like lambs?
\q1
\v 7 Tremble, you earth, at the presence of the Lord,
\q2 at the presence of the God of Jacob,
\q1
\v 8 who turned the rock into a pool of water,
\q2 the flint into a spring of waters.
