\v 1 May Yahweh answer you in the day of trouble.
\q2 May the name of the God of Jacob set you up on high,
\q2
\v 2 send you help from the sanctuary,
\q2 grant you support from Zion,
\q2
\v 3 remember all your offerings,
\q2 and accept your burned sacrifice. \qs Selah.\qs*

\v 4 May he grant you your heart’s desire,
\q2 and fulfill all your counsel.

\v 5 We will triumph in your salvation.
\q2 In the name of our God, we will set up our banners.
\q2 May Yahweh grant all your requests.

\v 6 Now I know that Yahweh saves his anointed.
\q2 He will answer him from his holy heaven,
\q2 with the saving strength of his right hand.
\q1
\v 7 Some trust in chariots, and some in horses,
\q2 but we trust in the name of Yahweh our God.
\q1
\v 8 They are bowed down and fallen,
\q2 but we rise up, and stand upright.
\q1
\v 9 Save, Yahweh!
\q2 Let the King answer us when we call!
