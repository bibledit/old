\c 75
\d For the Chief Musician. To the tune of “Do Not Destroy.” A Psalm by Asaph. A song.
\q1
\v 1 We give thanks to you, God.
\q2 We give thanks, for your Name is near.
\q2 Men tell about your wondrous works.
\b
\q1
\v 2 When I choose the appointed time,
\q2 I will judge blamelessly.
\q1
\v 3 The earth and all its inhabitants quake.
\q2 I firmly hold its pillars. \qs Selah.\qs*
\q1
\v 4 I said to the arrogant, “Don’t boast!”
\q2 I said to the wicked, “Don’t lift up the horn.
\q1
\v 5 Don’t lift up your horn on high.
\q2 Don’t speak with a stiff neck.”
\q1
\v 6 For neither from the east, nor from the west,
\q2 nor yet from the south, comes exaltation.
\q1
\v 7 But God is the judge.
\q2 He puts down one, and lifts up another.
\q1
\v 8 For in Yahweh’s hand there is a cup,
\q2 full of foaming wine mixed with spices.
\q1 He pours it out.
\q2 Indeed the wicked of the earth drink and drink it to its very dregs.
\b
\q1
\v 9 But I will declare this forever:
\q2 I will sing praises to the God of Jacob.
\q1
\v 10 I will cut off all the horns of the wicked,
\q2 but the horns of the righteous shall be lifted up.
\b
