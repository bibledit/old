\c 146
\q1
\v 1 Praise Yah!
\q2 Praise Yahweh, my soul.
\q1
\v 2 While I live, I will praise Yahweh.
\q2 I will sing praises to my God as long as I exist.
\q1
\v 3 Don’t put your trust in princes,
\q2 each a son of man in whom there is no help.
\q1
\v 4 His spirit departs, and he returns to the earth.
\q2 In that very day, his thoughts perish.
\q1
\v 5 Happy is he who has the God of Jacob for his help,
\q2 whose hope is in Yahweh, his God:
\q1
\v 6 who made heaven and earth,
\q2 the sea, and all that is in them;
\q2 who keeps truth forever;
\q1
\v 7 who executes justice for the oppressed;
\q2 who gives food to the hungry.
\q1 Yahweh frees the prisoners.
\q2
\v 8 Yahweh opens the eyes of the blind.
\q2 Yahweh raises up those who are bowed down.
\q2 Yahweh loves the righteous.
\q1
\v 9 Yahweh preserves the foreigners.
\q2 He upholds the fatherless and widow,
\q2 but he turns the way of the wicked upside down.
\q1
\v 10 Yahweh will reign forever;
\q2 your God, O Zion, to all generations.
\q1 Praise Yah!
