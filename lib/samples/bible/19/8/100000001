\q2 who has set your glory above the heavens!

\v 2 From the lips of babes and infants you have established strength,
\q2 because of your adversaries, that you might silence the enemy and the avenger.

\v 6 You make him ruler over the works of your hands.
\q2 You have put all things under his feet:
\q1
\v 7 All sheep and cattle,

\q2
\v 8 the birds of the sky, the fish of the sea,
\q2 and whatever passes through the paths of the seas.
\q1
\v 9 Yahweh, our Lord,
\q2 how majestic is your name in all the earth!
