\c 39
\d For the Chief Musician. For Jeduthun. A Psalm by David.
\q1
\v 1 I said, “I will watch my ways, so that I don’t sin with my tongue.
\q2 I will keep my mouth with a bridle while the wicked is before me.”
\q1
\v 2 I was mute with silence.
\q2 I held my peace, even from good.
\q2 My sorrow was stirred.
\q1
\v 3 My heart was hot within me.
\q2 While I meditated, the fire burned.
\q1 I spoke with my tongue:
\q2
\v 4 “Yahweh, show me my end,
\q2 what is the measure of my days.
\q2 Let me know how frail I am.
\q1
\v 5 Behold, you have made my days hand widths.
\q2 My lifetime is as nothing before you.
\q1 Surely every man stands as a breath.” \qs Selah.\qs*
\q1
\v 6 “Surely every man walks like a shadow.
\q2 Surely they busy themselves in vain.
\q2 He heaps up, and doesn’t know who shall gather.
\q1
\v 7 Now, Lord, what do I wait for?
\q2 My hope is in you.
\q1
\v 8 Deliver me from all my transgressions.
\q2 Don’t make me the reproach of the foolish.
\q1
\v 9 I was mute.
\q2 I didn’t open my mouth,
\q2 because you did it.
\q1
\v 10 Remove your scourge away from me.
\q2 I am overcome by the blow of your hand.
\q1
\v 11 When you rebuke and correct man for iniquity,
\q2 you consume his wealth like a moth.
\q1 Surely every man is but a breath.” \qs Selah.\qs*
\q1
\v 12 “Hear my prayer, Yahweh, and give ear to my cry.
\q2 Don’t be silent at my tears.
\q1 For I am a stranger with you,
\q2 a foreigner, as all my fathers were.
\q1
\v 13 Oh spare me, that I may recover strength,
\q2 before I go away and exist no more.”
