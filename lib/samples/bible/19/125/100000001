\c 125
\d A Song of Ascents.
\q1
\v 1 Those who trust in Yahweh are as Mount Zion,
\q2 which can’t be moved, but remains forever.
\q1
\v 2 As the mountains surround Jerusalem,
\q2 so Yahweh surrounds his people from this time forward and forever more.
\q1
\v 3 For the scepter of wickedness won’t remain over the allotment of the righteous;
\q2 so that the righteous won’t use their hands to do evil.
\q1
\v 4 Do good, Yahweh, to those who are good,
\q2 to those who are upright in their hearts.
\q1
\v 5 But as for those who turn away to their crooked ways,
\q2 Yahweh will lead them away with the workers of iniquity.
\q1 Peace be on Israel.
