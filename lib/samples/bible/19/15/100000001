\c 15
\d A Psalm by David.
\q1
\v 1 Yahweh, who shall dwell in your sanctuary?
\q2 Who shall live on your holy hill?
\q1
\v 2 He who walks blamelessly does what is right,
\q2 and speaks truth in his heart;
\q1
\v 3 He who doesn’t slander with his tongue,
\q2 nor does evil to his friend,
\q2 nor casts slurs against his fellow man;
\q1
\v 4 In whose eyes a vile man is despised,
\q2 but who honors those who fear Yahweh;
\q2 he who keeps an oath even when it hurts, and doesn’t change;
\q1
\v 5 he who doesn’t lend out his money for usury,
\q2 nor take a bribe against the innocent.
\b
\q1 He who does these things shall never be shaken.
