\c 43
\q1
\v 1 Vindicate me, God, and plead my cause against an ungodly nation.
\q2 Oh, deliver me from deceitful and wicked men.
\q1
\v 2 For you are the God of my strength. Why have you rejected me?
\q2 Why do I go mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?
\q1
\v 3 Oh, send out your light and your truth.
\q2 Let them lead me.
\q2 Let them bring me to your holy hill,
\q2 to your tents.
\q1
\v 4 Then I will go to the altar of God,
\q2 to God, my exceeding joy.
\q1 I will praise you on the harp, God, my God.
\q1
\v 5 Why are you in despair, my soul?
\q2 Why are you disturbed within me?
\q1 Hope in God!
\q2 For I shall still praise him:
\q2 my Savior, my helper, and my God.
