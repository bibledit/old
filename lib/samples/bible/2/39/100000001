\v 16 They made two settings of gold, and two gold rings, and put the two rings on the two ends of the breastplate.

\v 20 They made two more rings of gold, and put them on the two shoulder straps of the ephod underneath, in its front, close by its coupling, above the skillfully woven band of the ephod.
\v 21 They bound the breastplate by its rings to the rings of the ephod with a lace of blue, that it might be on the skillfully woven band of the ephod, and that the breastplate might not come loose from the ephod, as Yahweh commanded Moses.
\p
\v 22 He made the robe of the ephod of woven work, all of blue.
\v 23 The opening of the robe in the middle of it was like the opening of a coat of mail, with a binding around its opening, that it should not be torn.
\v 24 They made on the skirts of the robe pomegranates of blue, purple, scarlet, and twined linen.
\v 25 They made bells of pure gold, and put the bells between the pomegranates around the skirts of the robe, between the pomegranates;
\v 26 a bell and a pomegranate, a bell and a pomegranate, around the skirts of the robe, to minister in, as Yahweh commanded Moses.

\v 31 They tied to it a lace of blue, to fasten it on the turban above, as Yahweh commanded Moses.
\p
\v 32 Thus all the work of the tabernacle of the Tent of Meeting was finished. The children of Israel did according to all that Yahweh commanded Moses; so they did.
\v 33 They brought the tabernacle to Moses: the tent, with all its furniture, its clasps, its boards, its bars, its pillars, its sockets,
\v 34 the covering of rams’ skins dyed red, the covering of sea cow hides, the veil of the screen,
\v 35 the ark of the covenant with its poles, the mercy seat,
\v 36 the table, all its vessels, the show bread,
\v 37 the pure lamp stand, its lamps, even the lamps to be set in order, all its vessels, the oil for the light,
