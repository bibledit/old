\q1
\v 5 “Come, eat some of my bread,
\q2 Drink some of the wine which I have mixed!
\q1
\v 6 Leave your simple ways, and live.
\q2 Walk in the way of understanding.”

\v 7 One who corrects a mocker invites insult.

\v 12 If you are wise, you are wise for yourself.
\q2 If you mock, you alone will bear it.

\v 13 The foolish woman is loud,
\q2 undisciplined, and knows nothing.

\q2 on a seat in the high places of the city,
\q1
\v 15 to call to those who pass by,
\q2 who go straight on their ways,
\q1
\v 16 “Whoever is simple, let him turn in here.”
\q2 as for him who is void of understanding, she says to him,
\q1
\v 17 “Stolen water is sweet.
\q2 Food eaten in secret is pleasant.”
\q1
\v 18 But he doesn’t know that the departed spirits are there,
\q2 that her guests are in the depths of Sheol.\f + Sheol is the place of the dead.\f*
