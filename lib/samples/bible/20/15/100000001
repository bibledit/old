\q2 but one who has a cheerful heart enjoys a continual feast.
\q1

\q2 than great treasure with trouble.
\q1
\v 17 Better is a dinner of herbs, where love is,
\q2 than a fattened calf with hatred.
\q1

\q2 but the path of the upright is a highway.
\q1
\v 20 A wise son makes a father glad,
\q2 but a foolish man despises his mother.
