\v 1 I tell the truth in Christ. I am not lying, my conscience testifying with me in the Holy Spirit
\v 2 that I have great sorrow and unceasing pain in my heart.
\v 3 For I could wish that I myself were accursed from Christ for my brothers’ sake, my relatives according to the flesh
\v 4 who are Israelites; whose is the adoption, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the law, the service, and the promises;
\v 5 of whom are the fathers, and from whom is Christ as concerning the flesh, who is over all, God, blessed forever. Amen.
\p
\v 6 But it is not as though the word of God has come to nothing. For they are not all Israel that are of Israel.
\v 7 Neither, because they are Abraham’s offspring, are they all children. But, “your offspring will be accounted as from Isaac.”\x +

\v 8 That is, it is not the children of the flesh who are children of God, but the children of the promise are counted as heirs.
\v 9 For this is a word of promise, “At the appointed time I will come, and Sarah will have a son.”\x +

\v 10 Not only so, but Rebekah also conceived by one, by our father Isaac.
\v 11 For being not yet born, neither having done anything good or bad, that the purpose of God according to election might stand, not of works, but of him who calls,\f + NU puts the phrase “not of works, but of him who calls” at the beginning of verse 12 instead of the end of verse 11.\f*

\v 19 You will say then to me, “Why does he still find fault? For who withstands his will?”

\v 21 Or hasn’t the potter a right over the clay, from the same lump to make one part a vessel for honor, and another for dishonor?
\v 22 What if God, willing to show his wrath and to make his power known, endured with much patience vessels of wrath prepared for destruction,
\v 23 and that he might make known the riches of his glory on vessels of mercy, which he prepared beforehand for glory,
\v 24 us, whom he also called, not from the Jews only, but also from the Gentiles?

\v 30 What shall we say then? That the Gentiles, who didn’t follow after righteousness, attained to righteousness, even the righteousness which is of faith;
\v 31 but Israel, following after a law of righteousness, didn’t arrive at the law of righteousness.
\v 32 Why? Because they didn’t seek it by faith, but as it were by works of the law. They stumbled over the stumbling stone;
\v 33 even as it is written,
\q1 “Behold,\f + “Behold”, from “ἰδοὺ”, means look at, take notice, observe, see, or gaze at. It is often used as an interjection.\f* I lay in Zion a stumbling stone and a rock of offense;
\q2 and no one who believes in him will be disappointed.”\x +
