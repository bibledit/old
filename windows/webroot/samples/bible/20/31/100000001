\c 31
\p
\v 1 The words of king Lemuel; the revelation which his mother taught him.
\b
\q1
\v 2 “Oh, my son!
\q2 Oh, son of my womb!
\q2 Oh, son of my vows!
\q1
\v 3 Don’t give your strength to women,
\q2 nor your ways to that which destroys kings.
\q1
\v 4 It is not for kings, Lemuel;
\q2 it is not for kings to drink wine;
\q2 nor for princes to say, ‘Where is strong drink?’
\q1
\v 5 lest they drink, and forget the law,
\q2 and pervert the justice due to anyone who is afflicted.
\q1
\v 6 Give strong drink to him who is ready to perish;
\q2 and wine to the bitter in soul:
\q1
\v 7 Let him drink, and forget his poverty,
\q2 and remember his misery no more.
\q1
\v 8 Open your mouth for the mute,
\q2 in the cause of all who are left desolate.
\q1
\v 9 Open your mouth, judge righteously,
\q2 and serve justice to the poor and needy.”

\v 28 Her children rise up and call her blessed.
\q2 Her husband also praises her:
\q1
\v 29 “Many women do noble things,
\q2 but you excel them all.”
\q1
\v 30 Charm is deceitful, and beauty is vain;
\q2 but a woman who fears Yahweh, she shall be praised.
\q1
\v 31 Give her of the fruit of her hands!
\q2 Let her works praise her in the gates!
