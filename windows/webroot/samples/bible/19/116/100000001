\c 116
\q1
\v 1 I love Yahweh, because he listens to my voice,
\q2 and my cries for mercy.
\q1
\v 2 Because he has turned his ear to me,
\q2 therefore I will call on him as long as I live.
\q1
\v 3 The cords of death surrounded me,
\q2 the pains of Sheol\f + Sheol is the place of the dead.\f* got a hold of me.
\q2 I found trouble and sorrow.
\q1
\v 4 Then I called on Yahweh’s name:
\q2 “Yahweh, I beg you, deliver my soul.”
\q1
\v 5 Yahweh is Gracious and righteous.
\q2 Yes, our God is merciful.
\q1
\v 6 Yahweh preserves the simple.
\q2 I was brought low, and he saved me.
\q1
\v 7 Return to your rest, my soul,
\q2 for Yahweh has dealt bountifully with you.
\q1
\v 8 For you have delivered my soul from death,
\q2 my eyes from tears,
\q2 and my feet from falling.
\q1
\v 9 I will walk before Yahweh in the land of the living.
\q1
\v 10 I believed, therefore I said,
\q2 “I was greatly afflicted.”
\q1
\v 11 I said in my haste,
\q2 “All people are liars.”
\q1
\v 12 What will I give to Yahweh for all his benefits toward me?
\q2
\v 13 I will take the cup of salvation, and call on Yahweh’s name.
\q1
\v 14 I will pay my vows to Yahweh,
\q2 yes, in the presence of all his people.
\q1
\v 15 Precious in Yahweh’s sight is the death of his saints.
\q1
\v 16 Yahweh, truly I am your servant.
\q2 I am your servant, the son of your servant girl.
\q2 You have freed me from my chains.
\q1
\v 17 I will offer to you the sacrifice of thanksgiving,
\q2 and will call on Yahweh’s name.
\q1
\v 18 I will pay my vows to Yahweh,
\q2 yes, in the presence of all his people,
\q1
\v 19 in the courts of Yahweh’s house,
\q2 in the middle of you, Jerusalem.
\q1 Praise Yah!
