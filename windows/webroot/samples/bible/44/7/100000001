\v 1 The high priest said, “Are these things so?”
\p
\v 2 He said, “Brothers and fathers, listen. The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia, before he lived in Haran,
\v 3 and said to him, ‘Get out of your land and away from your relatives, and come into a land which I will show you.’\x +

\v 4 Then he came out of the land of the Chaldaeans and lived in Haran. From there, when his father was dead, God moved him into this land, where you are now living.
\v 5 He gave him no inheritance in it, no, not so much as to set his foot on. He promised that he would give it to him for a possession, and to his offspring after him, when he still had no child.
\v 6 God spoke in this way: that his offspring would live as aliens in a strange land, and that they would be enslaved and mistreated for four hundred years.
\v 7 ‘I will judge the nation to which they will be in bondage,’ said God, ‘and after that they will come out, and serve me in this place.’\x +

\v 8 He gave him the covenant of circumcision. So Abraham became the father of Isaac, and circumcised him the eighth day. Isaac became the father of Jacob, and Jacob became the father of the twelve patriarchs.
\p
\v 9 “The patriarchs, moved with jealousy against Joseph, sold him into Egypt. God was with him,
\v 10 and delivered him out of all his afflictions, and gave him favor and wisdom before Pharaoh, king of Egypt. He made him governor over Egypt and all his house.
\v 11 Now a famine came over all the land of Egypt and Canaan, and great affliction. Our fathers found no food.
\v 12 But when Jacob heard that there was grain in Egypt, he sent out our fathers the first time.
\v 13 On the second time Joseph was made known to his brothers, and Joseph’s race was revealed to Pharaoh.
\v 14 Joseph sent and summoned Jacob, his father, and all his relatives, seventy-five souls.
\v 15 Jacob went down into Egypt and he died, himself and our fathers,
\v 16 and they were brought back to Shechem, and laid in the tomb that Abraham bought for a price in silver from the children of Hamor of Shechem.
\p
\v 17 “But as the time of the promise came close which God had sworn to Abraham, the people grew and multiplied in Egypt,
\v 18 until there arose a different king, who didn’t know Joseph.
\v 19 The same took advantage of our race, and mistreated our fathers, and forced them to throw out their babies, so that they wouldn’t stay alive.
\v 20 At that time Moses was born, and was exceedingly handsome. He was nourished three months in his father’s house.
\v 21 When he was thrown out, Pharaoh’s daughter took him up and reared him as her own son.
\v 22 Moses was instructed in all the wisdom of the Egyptians. He was mighty in his words and works.
\v 23 But when he was forty years old, it came into his heart to visit his brothers,\f + The word for “brothers” here and where the context allows may be also correctly translated “brothers and sisters” or “siblings.”\f* the children of Israel.
\v 24 Seeing one of them suffer wrong, he defended him, and avenged him who was oppressed, striking the Egyptian.
\v 25 He supposed that his brothers understood that God, by his hand, was giving them deliverance; but they didn’t understand.
\p
\v 26 “The day following, he appeared to them as they fought, and urged them to be at peace again, saying, ‘Sirs, you are brothers. Why do you wrong one another?’
\v 27 But he who did his neighbor wrong pushed him away, saying, ‘Who made you a ruler and a judge over us?
\v 28 Do you want to kill me, as you killed the Egyptian yesterday?’\x +

\v 30 “When forty years were fulfilled, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in the wilderness of Mount Sinai, in a flame of fire in a bush.
\v 31 When Moses saw it, he wondered at the sight. As he came close to see, a voice of the Lord came to him,
