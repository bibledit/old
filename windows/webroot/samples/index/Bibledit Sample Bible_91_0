\ili2 Crucify means to execute someone by nailing them to a cross with metal spikes. Their hands are stretched out on the crossbeam with spikes driven through their wrists or hands. Their feet or ankles are attached to a cross with a metal spike. The weight of the victim’s body tends to force the air out of his lungs. To rise up to breathe, the victim has to put weight on the wounds, and use a lot of strength. The victim is nailed to the cross while the cross is on the ground, then the cross is raised up and dropped into a hole, thus jarring the wounds. Before crucifixion, the victim was usually whipped with a Roman cat of nine tails, which had bits of glass and metal tied to its ends. This caused chunks of flesh to be removed and open wounds to be placed against the raw wood of the cross. The victim was made to carry the heavy crossbeam of his cross from the place of judgment to the place of crucifixion, but often was physically unable after the scourging, so another person would be pressed into involuntary service to carry the cross for him. Roman crucifixion was generally done totally naked to maximize both shame and discomfort. Eventually, the pain, weakness, dehydration, and exhaustion of the muscles needed to breathe make breathing impossible, and the victim suffocates.
\ili \k cubit\k*
\ili2 A cubit is a unit of linear measure, from the elbow to the tip of the longest finger of a man. This unit is commonly converted to 0.46 meters or 18 inches, although that varies with height of the man doing the measurement.

\ili2 “Yah” is a shortened form of “Yahweh,” which is God’s proper name. This form is used occasionally in the Old Testament, mostly in the Psalms. See “Yahweh.”
\ili \k Yahweh\k*
\ili2 “Yahweh” is God’s proper name. In Hebrew, the four consonants roughly equivalent to YHWH were considered too holy to pronounce, so the Hebrew word for “Lord” (Adonai) was substituted when reading it aloud. When vowel points were added to the Hebrew Old Testament, the vowel points for “Adonai” were mixed with the consonants for “Yahweh,” which if you pronounced it literally as written, would be pronounced “Yehovah” or “Jehovah.” When the Old Testament was translated to Greek, the tradition of substituting “Lord” for God’s proper name continued in the translation of God’s name to “Lord” (Kurios). Some English Bibles translate God’s proper name to “LORD” or “GOD” (usually with small capital letters), based on that same tradition. This can get really confusing, since two other words (“Adonai” and “Elohim”) translate to “Lord” and “God,” and they are sometimes used together. The ASV of 1901 (and some other translations) render YHWH as “Jehovah.” The most probable pronunciation of God’s proper name is “Yahweh.” In Hebrew, the name “Yahweh” is related to the active declaration “I AM.” See
\zref 
\+ztgt EXO.3.13 
\+ztgt*
\zref*Exodus 3:13-14.
\zrefend 
\zrefend* Since Hebrew has no tenses, the declaration “I AM” can also be interpreted as “I WAS” and “I WILL BE.” Compare

\+ztgt*
\zref*Revelation 1:8.
\zrefend

\ili \k Zion\k*
\ili2 Zion is a name which originally referred one of the mountains of Jerusalem. It became a term synonymous with Jerusalem itself. The term “Heavenly Zion” is also used to refer the future dwelling place of God’s people.

\ili \k yahweh\k*
\ili2 “yahweh” is god’s proper name. in hebrew, the four consonants roughly equivalent to yhwh were considered too holy to pronounce, so the hebrew word for “lord” (adonai) was substituted when reading it aloud. when vowel points were added to the hebrew old testament, the vowel points for “adonai” were mixed with the consonants for “yahweh,” which if you pronounced it literally as written, would be pronounced “yehovah” or “jehovah.” when the old testament was translated to greek, the tradition of substituting “lord” for god’s proper name continued in the translation of god’s name to “lord” (kurios). some english bibles translate god’s proper name to “lord” or “god” (usually with small capital letters), based on that same tradition. this can get really confusing, since two other words (“adonai” and “elohim”) translate to “lord” and “god,” and they are sometimes used together. the asv of 1901 (and some other translations) render yhwh as “jehovah.” the most probable pronunciation of god’s proper name is “yahweh.” in hebrew, the name “yahweh” is related to the active declaration “i am.” see
