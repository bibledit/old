\v 10  And confirmed the same unto Jacob for a law, \add and\add*

\v 15  \add Saying\add*, Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets
no harm. 
\q1
\v 16  Moreover he called for a famine upon the land: he brake the whole

\q1
\v 17  He sent a man before them, \add even\add* Joseph, \add who\add*

\q1
\v 23  Israel also came into Egypt; and Jacob sojourned in the land
of Ham. 
\q1
\v 24  And he increased his people greatly; and made them stronger
than their enemies.

\q1
\v 25  He turned their heart to hate his people, to deal subtilly
with his servants. 
\q1
\v 26  He sent Moses his servant; \add and\add* Aaron whom he had

\v 27  They shewed his signs among them, and wonders in the land

\v 29  He turned their waters into blood, and slew their fish. 
\q1
\v 30  Their land brought forth frogs in abundance, in the chambers
of their kings. 
\q1
\v 31  He spake, and there came divers sorts of flies, \add and\add*

\q1
\v 32  He gave them hail for rain, \add and\add* flaming fire in their

number, 
\q1
\v 35  And did eat up all the herbs in their land, and devoured the
fruit of their ground. 
\q1
\v 36  He smote also all the firstborn in their land, the chief of all their
strength. 
\q1
\v 37  He brought them forth also with silver and gold: and \add there
was\add* not one feeble \add person\add* among their tribes. 
\q1
\v 38  Egypt was glad when they departed: for the fear of them fell upon them.
\q1
\v 39  He spread a cloud for a covering; and fire to give light in the

\q1
\v 40  \add The people\add* asked, and he brought quails, and satisfied
them with the bread of heaven. 
\q1
\v 41  He opened the rock, and the waters gushed out; they ran in the dry

\q1
\v 42  For he remembered his holy promise, \add and\add* Abraham

\q1
\v 43  And he brought forth his people with joy, \add and\add* his

\v 5  That I may see the good of thy chosen, that I may rejoice in the

\b
\q1
\v 6  We have sinned with our fathers, we have committed iniquity,
we have done wickedly. 
\q1
\v 7  Our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt; they remembered
not the multitude of thy mercies; but provoked \add him\add* at the
sea, \add even\add* at the Red sea. 
\q1
\v 8  Nevertheless he saved them for his name’s sake, that he might make his mighty
power to be known. 
\q1
\v 9  He rebuked the Red sea also, and it was dried up: so he led
them through the depths, as through the wilderness. 
\q1
\v 10  And he saved them from the hand of him that hated \add them\add*,
and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy. 
\q1
\v 11  And the waters covered their enemies: there was not one of them
left. 
\q1
\v 12  Then believed they his words; they sang his praise. 
\b
\q1
\v 13  They soon forgat his works; they waited not for his counsel:\f + 
\ft They soon…: Heb. They made haste, they forgat\f* 
\q1
\v 14  But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, and tempted God

\v 15  And he gave them their request; but sent leanness into their

\q1
\v 16  They envied Moses also in the camp, \add and\add* Aaron the
saint of the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\q1
\v 17  The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, and covered the
company of Abiram. 
\q1
\v 18  And a fire was kindled in their company; the flame burned
up the wicked. 
\q1
\v 19  They made a calf in Horeb, and worshipped the molten image.
\q1
\v 20  Thus they changed their glory into the similitude of an ox
that eateth grass. 
\q1
\v 21  They forgat God their saviour, which had done great things
in Egypt; 
\q1
\v 22  Wondrous works in the land of Ham, \add and\add* terrible
things by the Red sea. 
\q1
\v 23  Therefore he said that he would destroy them, had not Moses
his chosen stood before him in the breach, to turn away his wrath,
lest he should destroy \add them\add*. 
\q1
\v 24  Yea, they despised the pleasant land, they believed not his
word:\f +  \ft the pleasant…: Heb. a land of desire\f* 
\q1
\v 25  But murmured in their tents, \add and\add* hearkened not unto the

\q1
\v 26  Therefore he lifted up his hand against them, to overthrow
them in the wilderness:\f +  \ft to overthrow: Heb. to make them

\q1
\v 27  To overthrow their seed also among the nations, and to scatter
them in the lands.\f +  \ft To overthrow: Heb. To make them fall\f*
\q1
\v 28  They joined themselves also unto Baal-peor, and ate the sacrifices
of the dead. 
\q1
\v 29 Thus they provoked \add him\add* to anger with their inventions:
and the plague brake in upon them. 
\q1
\v 30  Then stood up Phinehas, and executed judgment: and \add so\add*
the plague was stayed. 
\q1
\v 31  And that was counted unto him for righteousness unto all generations
for evermore. 
\q1
\v 32  They angered \add him\add* also at the waters of strife, so that it went
ill with Moses for their sakes: 
\q1
\v 33  Because they provoked his spirit, so that he spake unadvisedly
with his lips. 
\b
\q1
\v 34  They did not destroy the nations, concerning whom the \nd LORD\nd*
commanded them: 
\q1
\v 35  But were mingled among the heathen, and learned their works.
\q1
\v 36  And they served their idols: which were a snare unto them.
\q1
\v 37  Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto devils,
\q1
\v 38  And shed innocent blood, \add even\add* the blood of their
sons and of their daughters, whom they sacrificed unto the idols
of Canaan: and the land was polluted with blood. 
\q1
\v 39  Thus were they defiled with their own works, and went a whoring
with their own inventions. 
\q1
\v 40  Therefore was the wrath of the \nd LORD\nd* kindled against his
people, insomuch that he abhorred his own inheritance. 
\q1
\v 41  And he gave them into the hand of the heathen; and they that
hated them ruled over them. 
\q1
\v 42  Their enemies also oppressed them, and they were brought into
subjection under their hand. 
\q1
\v 43  Many times did he deliver them; but they provoked \add him\add*
with their counsel, and were brought low for their iniquity.\f + 
\ft brought…: or, impoverished, or, weakened\f* 
\q1
\v 44  Nevertheless he regarded their affliction, when he heard their
cry: 
\q1
\v 45  And he remembered for them his covenant, and repented according to the
multitude of his mercies. 
\q1
\v 46  He made them also to be pitied of all those that carried them
captives. 
\q1
\v 47  Save us, O \nd LORD\nd* our God, and gather us from among the

\q1
\v 4  They wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way; they found
no city to dwell in. 
\q1
\v 5  Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted  in them. 
\q1
\v 6  Then they cried unto the \nd LORD\nd* in their trouble, \add and\add*

\q1
\v 13  Then they cried unto the \nd LORD\nd* in their trouble, \add and\add*
