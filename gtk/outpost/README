Bibledit Windows Outpost

The Bibledit Windows Outpost acts as an outpost for Bibledit. 
It accesses things in Windows that Bibledit, as a native Linux application,
cannot reach.
Bibledit communicates with the Outpost through the network,
and the Outpost acts on Windows as controlled by Bibledit.


Delphi 6 Professional was used to write the Bibledit Windows Outpost.

Here follow a few simple steps to take to get the programmer up and running:

Create a new application, and save the project as "bwoutpost".

According to page 35-3 of the Delphi Developer's Guide, import the Type Library from BibleWorks 8:
menu Project / Import Type Library; select the BW800 ... library, then press Install, then a few times OK.
From the ActiveX palette, drop the BibleWorks VCL wrapper onto the Form.
Set the property AutoConnect to False, and set the Name to BibleWorksAutomation

For the TCP/IP communication add a ServerSocket from the Internet palette.
Set the following properties:
Active: True
Port: 51515

Import the type library from the Online Bible: Online Bible Com Interface.
Drop the wrapper onto the Form.
Set the properties as follows:
AutoConnect: False
Name: OnlineBibleAutomation


The support for the Online Bible was implemented after looking at the example at
