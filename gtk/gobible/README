In November 2009 David Haslam said:

There is no objection in principle to packaging Go Bible Creator with Bibledit, 
especially as it has a significant benefit to translation teams.
There are certain practical requirements that arise.
You should set up a procedure to ensure that what is packaged is always the latest release.

The GoBibleCreator is licenced under the GPL.

The following files from the GoBibleCreator zipped package should be included:
GoBibleCore1.jar
GoBibleCore2.jar
GoBibleCreator.jar
ui.properties
