This is a description of how to install bibledit-gtk on Windows.
It assumes you have already gone through the BUILDING process.

Step #1
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
As Administrator, run the MINGW Shell of your choice (32 or 64)

cd 32bit/bibledit/gtk
  or
cd 64bit/bibledit/gtk

./windows/installWin.sh

This will copy all necessary files from the bibledit repository,
the msys2 development environment, and it will fetch bwoutpost.exe
from the web for installation. It will install in either

32-bit:		C:\Program Files (x86)\Bibledit-x.y.z\
64-bit:		C:\Program Files\Bibledit-x.y.z\

Inside of that directory, you will see
	editor\bin
	editor\lib
	editor\share
	
You can execute bibledit-gtk from editor\bin\bibledit-gtk.exe

Create an icon on your desktop or in your Start Menu and you are good
to go!

Optional Step #2
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Download the texlive-xetex package from

http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet/install-tl-windows.exe

1. Install it in the default directory. It will add an entry to your Windows 
PATH environment variable which is important for Bibledit-gtk. 

2. Depending on the options you select, this will install up to 4 GB (that's 
right, gigabytes) of packages to use in tex.

Optional Step #3
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Download the php-cli package and install it.

1. It is probably best to get it directly from
	http://windows.php.net/downloads/releases/php-5.6.19-Win32-VC11-x86.zip
	I chose php 5.6.19, latest in the 5 series, not to go to version 7.0.
	I chose the thread-safe version since we have threading going on in bibledit-gtk.
	So I chose VC11 x86 Thread Safe (2016-Mar-03 05:51:49)
	I did NOT choose x64 builds because they were listed as experimental.

2. To install, all you have to do is to unpack the archive into C:\php

3. Add C:\php to your path. To do this, right click My Computer, select 
	Properties, Click Advanced System Settings on the left, click Environment 
	Variables button in the lower right, select Path, edit, and add the 
	following text to the end of the line:              ;C:\php
	Note the semicolon.
	Also, if you want to move that farther ahead in the PATH, that is 
	fine too, just be careful!
	Hit OK about 3 times.
