        This dialog is accessible through the menu / Edit / Status.
      </p>
      <p>
        Bibledit supports simple project status reporting. In this dialog the status of a project or part of the project can be set.
      </p>
      <p>
        The dialog consists of four columns. The first one shows all the books, the second one shows all the chapters in a particular book, and the third one displays all the verse in a particular chapter. Finally the last column shows all the tasks that <a href="../../../../gtk/reference/menu/menu-preferences/planning-setup.html">have been defined for the project</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        To mark a particular task as being done for a whole book, just select that book in the list, and put a tick in the task.
      </p>
      <p>
        To mark a task as being done for just one chapter, select the book and the chapter in the list, and put a tick in that task.
      </p>
      <p>
        And to mark a task as being done for one verse only, select book, chapter, and verse in the lists, and tick that task.
      </p>
      <p>
        Notes.
      </p>
      <p>
        1. If a task is checked, it means that it has been done.
      </p>
      <p>
        2. If a task is unchecked, it means that this one has yet to be done.
      </p>
      <p>
        3. At times there is another symbol that indicates that the task has not been consistently completed. Such a state occurs when for example the status of a chapter is displayed, and not all the verses of that chapter have a particular task completed. Some have, and others don't.
      </p>
      <p>
        4. To set the task that have been done for a range of books at once, select the boosk you want, and put tick the task that has been done for that book. Tasks can also be set for a range of chapters, or a range of verses.
