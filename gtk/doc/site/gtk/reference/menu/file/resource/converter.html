        Bibledit provides a tool that makes a web page fit as a <a href="../../../../../gtk/resources/internal-resource.html">Resource</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The tool will add the appropriate anchors at the appropriate locations in that web page.
      </p>
      <p>
        Various buttons and settings will enable the user to write the right anchors at the right places. These are described below.
      </p>
      <h4>
        <a name="resourcetype" href="" id="resourcetype"></a>Resource type
      </h4>
      <p>
        Press the "Type" button to select what type of resource conversion is to be done.
      </p>
      <h4>
        <a name="openfile" href="" id="openfile"></a>Open file
      </h4>
      <p>
        Pressing button "Open" allows the user to open a file for conversion.
      </p>
      <h4>
        <a name="viewfile" href="" id="viewfile"></a>View file
      </h4>
      <p>
        Viewing the file is important in order to find out what type of web page it is and how the anchors should be placed. If the "View" button is pressed, the web page opens in a web browser. Modern web browsers also allow the user to view the source of the page. This comes in helpful because the resource converter works with the raw text.
      </p>
      <h4>
        <a name="chapterdetection" href="" id="chapterdetection"></a>Chapter detection
      </h4>
      <p>
        To allow the resource converter to find the places where a chapter starts, a mechanism has been provided that takes a chapter pattern to look for. If that particular pattern is found, the resource converter will place the anchor there. Here is an example of a chapter starting in raw html code:
      </p>
      <p>
        &lt;p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0mm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:tyle='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif";mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman"'&gt;II. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;spanstyle='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif";mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman"'&gt;Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and &amp;#65279 ... and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
        This raw html code gives the beginning of chapter two of the book of Genesis. It can be seen in this raw code that chapter two can be found by looking for "&gt;II. &lt;". Chapter three would be found as "&gt;III. &lt;". And so on. It can be seen that the prefix is "&gt;", that the chapter uses Roman numerals, and that the suffix is ". &lt;". So then, if these values are entered in the chapter detection pattern, things will work out fine.
      </p>
      <h4>
        <a name="versedetection" href="" id="versedetection"></a>Verse detection
      </h4>
      <p>
        The verse detection works similar to the chapter detection system described above.
      </p>
      <h4>
        <a name="writinganchors" href="" id="writinganchors"></a>Writing anchors
      </h4>
      <p>
        If the "Write" button is pressed, then any old anchors ever added by Bibledit will be removed from the file that was opened, new anchors will be written using the chapter and verse detection mechanisms, and the file will be written to disk.
