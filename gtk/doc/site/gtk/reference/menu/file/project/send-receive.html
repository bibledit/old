        Send / receive
      </h1>This sends and receives your Bibles. It works when you have enabled <a href="../../../../../gtk/tutorials/collaboration.html">collaboration</a> for one or more Bibles. Normally the collaboration system send and receives the changes made in Bibles. It does that at intervals as set up by the user. When choosing "Send / receive" through the menu, sending and receiving Bibles is done immediately, regardless of the interval that was specified by the user.
