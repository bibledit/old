      <p>
        You can export the data from Bibledit. All export is done from the Export Assistant. See menu File / Export. You can export a Bible, or the References, or a Stylesheet, among other things.
      </p>

      </h4>
      <p>
        In case that you export everything, it will ask you to select a directory to put all the USFM files in. Bibledit will put one USFM file per book into that directory. Or if the export if compressed, all the files will be stored in a zipped archive.
      </p>
      <p>
        In case that you export only the changes, matters are slightly different. This only exports the changes since last time you did this, or since a certain date and time. This can be chosen.

      </h4>
      <p>
        When exporting a Bible to BibleWorks Version Database Compiler, a text file is produced that can be imported in the BibleWorks Version Database Compiler for display in BibleWorks. See the BibleWorks online help for detailed information.
      </p>
      <h4>
        <a name="openscriptureinformationstandard" href="" id="openscriptureinformationstandard"></a>Open Scripture Information Standard
      </h4>
      <p>
        An attempt is made to produce a valid OSIS file. The standard transformation is the recommended one. Or if the OSIS file is going to be used for creating a Go Bible, you can produce a variant for the Go Bible Creator.
      </p>
      <h4>
        <a name="crosswiresword" href="" id="crosswiresword"></a>Crosswire SWORD
      </h4>
      <p>
        When exporting to a SWORD module, the module is created and installed straightaway. Normally Bibledit will install the SWORD module to subdirectory .sword in the home directory, but this can be changed. Provide a name for the module and export it. After restarting the Sword enabled Bible reader, the module should be visible in the program.
      </p>
      <p>
        While creating a Sword module, <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/bibledit/gtk/reference/menu/file/export-assistant/sword-module">some settings need to be made.</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Module path is the directory where a zipped module will be stored. This module is fit for immediate distribution.
      </p>
      <p>
        Exporting to SWORD produces an intermediate OSIS file, which is placed in the home directory. This file will be compiled by osis2mod, the SWORD compiler.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently there are two methods for exporting to an OSIS file and a Sword module. There is the "Old method". This divides the text into books, chapters and verses. Then there's the "Recommended transformation". This divides the text into books, sections and paragraphs. At the moment of writing the osis2mod compiler is not capable of producing a proper Sword module out of the OSIS file created with the new method.
      </p>
      <p>
        If one method fails to produce the result that you'd like to see, try the other one.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can also export to an OSIS variant that is fit for the Go Bible Creator.
      </p>
      <h4>
        <a name="opendocument" href="" id="opendocument"></a>OpenDocument
      </h4>
      <p>
        This will ask you where to save the file, and then does the export. The file can be opened in the various wordprocessors that support OpenDocument, such as AbiWord, KWord, OpenOffice, etc. The main purpose of this export is to be able to transfer the formatted text into other applications. For that reason several style settings, like two columns, are unsupported.
      </p>
      <p>
        It makes use of a template. This template is a simple document in OpenDocument format. Under normal circumstances this template is stored at /usr/share/bibledit-gtk/template.odt. If you really like to change the OpenDocument export, you can modify the template.
      </p>
      <h4>
        <a name="gobible" href="" id="gobible"></a>Go Bible
      </h4>
      <p>
        This will create a Go Bible. It runs on a cell phone. You need to have a working Java runtime environment. This can be installed through your distribution's software installation mechanism.
      </p>
      <h3>
        <a name="references" href="" id="references"></a>References
      </h3>
      <p>
        You can export all the references that are now in the References Area. This saves them to a file on disk, one references per line.
      </p>
      <h3>
        <a name="stylesheet" href="" id="stylesheet"></a>Stylesheet
      </h3>
      <p>
        You can export the stylesheet. The one that displays will be exported.
      </p>
      <h3>
        <a name="notes" href="" id="notes"></a>Notes
      </h3>
      <p>
        You can export the notes and save them to file in a format that is easily readable.
      </p>
      <h3>
        <a name="keyterms" href="" id="keyterms"></a>Keyterms
      </h3>
      <p>
        The keyterms can be exported to a web page. The collection of keyterms that the window for checking keyterms shows will be exported.
