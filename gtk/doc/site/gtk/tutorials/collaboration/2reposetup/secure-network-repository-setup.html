      </h3>Doing this on github.com is easy. Create an account there, and then create a git repository.If your username is "joe", and your password is "pazz", and the repository is "repo", then accessing this repository through https works through this URL:<span style="line-height:1.6;font-size:10pt"><font face="courier new, monospace">https://joe:pazz@github.com/joe/repo.git</font></span><span style="line-height:1.6;font-size:10pt"><br /></span><span style="line-height:1.6;font-size:10pt">Another type of secure git repository can be created on for example s</span><span style="font-size:10pt;line-height:1.6">ourceforge.net.</span>
      <p>
        <span style="line-height:1.6;font-size:10pt">Open an account on</span> <a href="http://sourceforge.net/" style="line-height:1.6;font-size:10pt" rel="nofollow">sourceforge.net</a><span style="line-height:1.6;font-size:10pt">. We will use the username "joe" in this tutorial.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        Register a new project on your personal account page on sourceforge.net. Let's call this project "repo2".
      </p>
      <p>
        Enable project feature "Git" on this project. This provides the repository.
      </p>
      <p>
        The next thing is to try whether you can read the repository properly. To try that, open a terminal and issue the following command:
      </p>
      <pre>
git ls-remote ssh://joe@repo2.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/repo2/repo2
</pre>
      <p>
        This command probably will ask for your password, and the first time it could ask you whether you want to continue connecting. But it should show no errors. If it completes without errors, then your secure repository works well.
      </p>
      <p>
        The repository that was created in this tutorial has the following URL:
      </p>
      <pre>
ssh://user@repo2.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/repo2/repo2
</pre>
      <p>
        The users that are going to use this repository need this URL. Where it says "user", each user would need to fill in his own username.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        Each user will need to open his or her own account on sourceforge.net. After that, they need to open an e-mail from sourceforge.net and click the link to activate their account. Each user needs to be registered as a member of the project, in this example, project "repo2". This is so that the user can write to the repository.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        So the moderator (or the person to first set up the repository) will need to log onto to his account at sourceforge.net,
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>click on “account” in the upper right,&nbsp;
        </li>
        <li>choose the projects tab,&nbsp;
        </li>
        <li>click on the project name,&nbsp;
        </li>
        <li>then click View all files.
        </li>
        <li>Now there will be a series of tabs at the top which expand if your mouse cursor hovers above them. Go to the last one, Project Admin, and click Members.
        </li>
        <li>Finally! From there you will be add any members who have activated their accounts by clicking in the e-mail that was sent to them.
        </li>
        <li>
