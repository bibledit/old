      <h1>
        Checking
      </h1>
      <h3>
        <a name="TOC-Introduction" href="" id="TOC-Introduction"></a>Introduction
      </h3>
      <p>
        Bibledit contains a number of tools to check the text. Most of these are accessible through menu Check.
      </p>
      <p>
        Any undesired checking results can be hidden for the future, so that they don't appear again if the same check is ran again. To hide such a result, right-click in the References Area, and choose "Hide from now on".
      </p>
      <h3>
        <a name="characterinventory" href="" id="characterinventory"></a>Character inventory
      </h3>
      <p>
        This check, accessible through the menu, Check - Characters - Inventory, gives a list of all characters in the project, and the count of each character.
      </p>
      <p>
        Due to newline handling on Linux the character counter will only include U+000A but not U+000D. After importing the file the U+000D completely disappears and so will not be counted.
      </p>
      <p>
        A character can occur anywhere in the output html file, depending on how sorting is done.
      </p>
      <p>
        The file will be visible in the Internet browser, which will supply its own default font so as to ensure the character becomes visible. No particular font is enforced.
      </p>
      <p>
        The check does not handle legacy encoded data. This is because anything with such data will be converted to Unicode when imported in Bibledit, and so the character counting check will never encounter anything else but Unicode.
      </p>
      <h3>
        <a name="comparepunctuation" href="" id="comparepunctuation"></a>Compare punctuation
      </h3>
      <p>
        Paratext had a check called "Compare Punctuation". How do I compare punctuation in Bibledit?
      </p>
      <p>
        Comparing punctuation in Bibledit is done through the Advanced Find functions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Open the first project, and search for e.g. a question mark. The search results will be loaded in the References Area.
      </p>
      <p>
        Open the second project, and go to advanced search, and search for the question mark again. Remove the search results from the ones already in the References Area. The References Area will now contain the verses that do have the question mark in the first project, and not in the second.
      </p>
      <p>
        Next do it the other way round. Search in the second project, then with advanced search in the first. The References Area will now contain the verses that do have the question mark in the second project, but not in the first.
      </p>
      <h3>
        <a name="checkmatchingpairs" href="" id="checkmatchingpairs"></a>Check matching pairs
      </h3>
      <p>
        Checks whether punctuation that is part of a pair makes a complete pair. For example, the opening bracket [ also needs the closing bracket ].
      </p>
      <p>
        The check knows about 160 matching pairs of punctuation, and checks them all.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pairs that should not be checked can be ignored. No reports will be given on these characters.
      </p>
      <h3>
        <a name="checkunwantedpatterns" href="" id="checkunwantedpatterns"></a>Check unwanted patterns
      </h3>
      <p>
        This check looks for patterns that are unwanted. For example, when the pattern " ?", that is a question mark preceded by a space, is unwanted, enter this in the dialog box of the check, and from now on this unwanted pattern will be reported.
      </p>
      <h3>
        <a name="checkunwantedwords" href="" id="checkunwantedwords"></a>Check unwanted words
      </h3>
      <p>
        This looks for unwanted whole words in the text, and reports them when they have been found.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the dialog, you can enter a list of whole words to be looked for, one word per line.
      </p>
      <h3>
        <a name="repeatingwords" href="" id="repeatingwords"></a>Repeating words
      </h3>
      <p>
        This check aims to find repeating words, as sometimes, but not always, repeating words are a mistake. For example if the text has "Jesus said said: Whoever follows me ...", then the "said said" is a repeating word entered by mistake. This check will find these.
      </p>
      <p>
        This check will also find repeating words that are not a mistake. For example consider this USFM text:
      </p>
      <pre>
\x - \xo 1.6: \xt Matt. 10.2; 3 John 1:1.\x*
</pre>
      <p>
        This check will say that the word "1" repeats. It does so because the crossreference "3 John 1:1" has a repeating "1". Both chapter and verse are 1. To prevent these false hits enter an "Ignore" word of ":". If this colon is entered in the list, it no longer will find the "1" repeating.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some languages have words with reduplicated roots which could be separated with hyphens, e.g., manuk-manuk. The check will mark "manuk" as repeating. If the hyphen (-) is entered under the "Ignore" button, then this words will no longer be marked as repeating.
      </p>
      <h3>
        <a name="notes" href="" id="notes"></a>Notes
      </h3>
      <p>
        Some of the checks produce references in the reference area. The references so produced can be used to quickly go to the relevant places in the Bible. And the references can also be printed.
