        During the process of translation many notes will be made that related to the project.
      </p>
      <p>
        Project notes are stored in a database, and are independent of any Bible text. That is, whichever project is opened or closed, the notes remain the same.

        To make a new project note press Ctrl+N.
      </p>
      <p>
        To edit an existing project note click on the blue reference(s) for that note.
      </p>
      <p>
        When creating a new note or editing an existing one, the project notes window splits up into two so as to make space for a couple of controls.
      </p>
      <p>
        Project notes can be deleted by clicking on the blue [delete] link.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some keyboard shortcuts help while editing notes. An example will show how: The user edits the text of a project. To make a new note, he presses Ctrl+N. He types some text in the note. If he wishes to change to category of the note, he presses Alt+A, then Enter to open the list of categories, then he makes a selection with Up Arrow or Down Arrow and presses Enter to confirm the selection. If he wishes to add some references, he pressed Alt+R and types some references. Alt+O saves the note, and takes the user back to where he was editing the text. Ctrl-I puts the text in italics, Ctrl-B makes it bold, and Ctrl-U underlines it.
      </p>
      <p>
        When a project note is being edited, the creator of the note can be retrieved through menu View / More information on current note. Other information about this note is visible there as well, like the date it was created, and when it was edited.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each note falls into a category. The various categories and the default category can be set in the <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/bibledit/gtk/reference/menu/menu-preferences/project-notes">preferences</a>.

        This tool searches exacty (except case sensitive) for the sequence of characters entered into the "Search for" box, punctuation marks and spaces included. Case sensitive can be switched on or off.

        Project notes usually have one reference. This is the one for which the note was created. But additional references can be added as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        These references are shown attached to each note.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are two ways to get these notes into the references window.
      </p>
      <p>
        1. Open a note to edit it. In the menu choose Edit - Get references from project note.
      </p>
      <p>
        2. Click on the blue word [references] of a note.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a result the references will be loaded in the references window. Once there they can be activated and the text belonging to that reference will appear in the text editor.
      </p>

        Many people have one project with the actual text, and a separate project for their project notes. There is a historical reason for doing so. This separate project may have checking questions, answers from native helpers, a history of different renderings, commentary support, notes following consultant checks, and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
        It would be a lot of work to copy and paste these notes into the project notes one verse at a time.
      </p>
      <p>
        The tool "Transfer text to project", under the Tools menu, helps you with this.
      </p>
      <p>
        It transfers all text that is in the currently opened project into the project notes.
      </p>
      <p>
        It takes a good while to do this.
      </p>

      <p>
        If project notes need to overlap the chapter boundaries, the reference can be manually entered like, for example: Luke 2:2-3:3. Bibledit will divide this into two parts: Luke 2 verse 2 to the end of the chapter, and Luke 3 verse 1 to 3.

        Project notes can be exported into some formats.
      </p>
      <p>
        * Bibledit Notes version 3. This is the format used by the current version of Bibledit. In other words, notes exported through this option can be imported in Bibledit.
      </p>
      <p>
        * ScriptureNotes version 2.0. Notes exported in this format can be imported by Translation Notes Editor 6.0.
      </p>
      <p>
        To see how these formats looks, just export some text and open the exported text in a text editor.
      </p>
      <h2>
        <a name="TOC-Sharing-notes" href="" id="TOC-Sharing-notes"></a>Sharing notes
      </h2>
      <p>
        The notes that you make on your computer can be shared with other members of the team. These notes you make will then also be available to the members of the team, and the notes made by any member of the team will also become available to you.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        You can set the sharing up through the <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/bibledit/gtk/reference/menu/menu-preferences/dialog-remote-repository">Remote Repository Assistant</a>. Normally this assistant sets up project sharing. But it can also set up notes sharing. Just make the appropriate selection at the start of the assistant. It will be good to read the entire section about <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/bibledit/gtk/tutorials/collaboration">Collaboration</a> if you need to set it up, since it fully explains the technical details.
      </p>
      <p>
        Notes are stored in flat files, but selected from an index. If the index for some reason gets corrupted or out of sync, then you can recreate it by either deleting the index manually from directory ~/.bibledit/notes and then restarting Bibledit, or by setting the sharing up again through the remote repository assistant.
      </p>
      <p>
        Menu File - Project notes - Send / Receive to a manual sync of your notes with the remote repository. Normally the sync is done automatically, though, by default it is done every hour, but you can change this in the remote repository assistant.
