        <a name="howtoruntwoversionsofbibleditsimultanously" href="" id="howtoruntwoversionsofbibleditsimultanously"></a>How to run two versions of Bibledit simultaneously?
      </h4>
      <p>
        As there are some drastic changes between versions, it would be helpful to have two different versions running of Bibledit.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is possible, but not recommended for production work, as they will be overwriting each other's configuration.
      </p>
      <p>
        Do it this way.
      </p>
      <p>
        Install the newer version according to the instructions.
      </p>
      <p>
        When installing the older version, do this:
      </p>
      <pre>
./configure --prefix=/home/joe/older<br />make<br />sudo make install
</pre>
      <p>
        Then to run the older version, type this:
      </p>
      <pre>
/home/joe/older/bin/bibledit
</pre>
      <p>
        Joe stands for the user's name.

      </h4>
      <p>
        You can fully configure in which order Bibledit displays and prints the books. This can be done in menu, Preferences, Books. Drag the books in the order you desire, and then click OK to save the settings.

        <a name="howtomodifytheplacewherebibleditstoresitsdata" href="" id="howtomodifytheplacewherebibleditstoresitsdata"></a>How to modify the place where Bibledit stores its data?
      </h4>
      <p>
        Normally Bibledit stores its data in subdirectory ".bibledit" of the user's home directory, e.g. in
      </p>
      <pre>
/home/joe/.bibledit
</pre>
      <p>
        If it is desirable to have Bibledit store its data elsewhere, the solution is simple:
      </p>
      <p>
        1. Move the current .bibledit directory to the new directory.
      </p>
      <p>
        2. Create a symbolic link from .bibledit to that new directory.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is a different way of pointing Bibledit to another data directory.
      </p>
      <p>
        Changing is not done from within bibledit, but involves some manual work. This is done for the protection of your valuable data. To change the data directory to a new location, do the following:
      </p>
      <p>
        Quit bibledit.
      </p>
      <p>
        Open a terminal.
      </p>
      <p>
        Type command
      </p>
      <pre>
cd
</pre>
      <p>
        to go to your home directory. Let's say you prefer to store the data on /mnt/server/.bibledit
      </p>
      <p>
        Type command
      </p>
      <pre>
mv .bibledit /mnt/server/.bibledit
</pre>
      <p>
        to preserve and move existing data. (When there is no existing data, this step is not needed.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Type command
      </p>
      <pre>
touch .bibledit-datafolder-pointer
</pre>
      <p>
        to make a new file in the home directory, that will point to the new data directory.
      </p>
      <p>
        Open this hidden file in a text editor and put only this one line in it:
      </p>
      <pre>
/mnt/server/.bibledit
</pre>
      <p>
        That's it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Removing file .bibledit-datafolder-pointer will cause bibledit to use the standard datafolder again.
      </p>

      <p>
        Note: It is not recommended to store the data on a Windows partition. In such cases problems have been observed when special characters are used in the project name.

      </h2>
      <p>
        In the example below we're going to learn how to write a table of contents for a project consisting of several books.
      </p>
      <p>
        The table of contents comes in the book called Front Matter. Therefore, add this book to the project.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each book that should go into the table of contents should have a USFM indicating this. Therefore, go to chapter 0 of each book and add the \toc2 marker to it. For example, in the book of Genesis, chapter 0 might look like
      </p>
      <pre>
\id GEN<br />\h Genesis<br />\toc2 Genesis
</pre>
      <p>
        Do this for all the books.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then print the project, and be sure to include all the books, including Front Matter. The table of contents will be there.

      </h4>
      <p>
        If the versification system or language you need does not come with Bibledit, then you can create your own language or versification system and add it to Bibledit yourself. To do that, take an existing versification textfile or language textfile from /usr/share/bibledit-gtk, edit it, and save it in the <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/bibledit/gtk/4-management/data">data directory</a>, subdirectory templates.
      </p>
      <p>
        Notes.
      </p>
      <p>
        The versification files start with versification_, the mapping files with mapping_, and the language files with language_. It is important to keep that first bit, else Bibledit won't recognize the files.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the name of a template you added is the same as the name one of the templates that come with Bibledit, your template will be taken.
      </p>
      <p>
        It would be greatly appreciated if you were willing to share the files you have created with others. In that way others will benefit from the work that you have already done. A good way of sharing it with the community is to submit it for inclusion into Bibledit. That way it becomes available to others in the next release.

        Reply: When installing it on Windows, install Cygwin first. See <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/bibledit/gtk/installation/windows">Bibledit's Windows installation instructions</a>. Then execute all commands from within the Cygwin terminal.

      <p>
        This happens when you did not install a C compiler.Installing Bibledit from source requires a C compiler. This compiler is part of development tools. The installation instructions for Linux, or for Macintosh, or Windows, give instructions on how to install such development tools. If you follow these instructions, the problem will be gone. For example, on Windows, you need to install package "gcc" in Cygwin.

        <a name="doeswinerunaprogramthatisalreadyonmywindowspartition" href="" id="doeswinerunaprogramthatisalreadyonmywindowspartition"></a>Problem when Outpost runs on another host
      </h2>
      <p>
        Q. When setting up the Outpost to run on another host, in the settings dialog, when I type in the name of the host, I get this error message: Host &lt;name&gt; cannot be contacted through the network.
      </p>
      <p>
        A. Points to check:
      </p>
      <p>
        1. Is the hostname you are entering the one set in Windows on the other host?
      </p>
      <p>
        2. Try finding out Windows' IP address, and then pinging it from Linux. If that works, enter that IP number in the Outpost Setup dialog.
      </p>
      <p>
        3. If the IP number changes continually, enter a static IP number in Windows.
      </p>
      <p>
        4. Is the Outpost installed and running in Windows? It has to be started manually, because Bibledit can't start it over the network.
      </p>
      <p>
        5. Be sure that the Windows firewall does not block port 51515 for incoming connections.
      </p>
      <p>
        6. Be sure that you have typed the right IP number. It can be checked by opening a Command Prompt in Windows, and typing "ipconfig". The IP number assigned to the network should correspond with the one you entered.

      <p>
        This message can be either from the text or the notes database. It has been seen in cases of malfunctioning hardware, such as unreliable memory. The solution is to solve the hardware problem first, and restore the text or the notes from a backup.

      <p>
        This is caused by downgrading from a newer version of sqlite3 to an older version. This may occur when the data is moved from a newer version of Linux to an older version. A possible solution is to install the newest version of sqlite3 in your current system. It will then be able to read your data again.

        <a name="bibleditwontstartanymore" href="" id="bibleditwontstartanymore"></a>Bibledit won't start anymore
      </h4>
      <p>
        Try starting it from a terminal, and see what happens. In the terminal type:
      </p>
      <pre>
bibledit
</pre>
      <p>
        If it gives a segmentation fault, then there is a problem in your configuration. A simple way to get Bibledit running again is to delete the file ./bibledit/settings and ./bibledit/configuration/configuration.xml. You will loose all your settings, but not your data, and Bibledit should start again after that.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you wish to have this problem solved, before deleting your configuration files, make a bug report, pack all your data in a gzipped tarball, and attach this file to the <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/bibledit/community/development">bug report</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        To go to the home directory, type
      </p>
      <pre>
cd
</pre>
      <p>
        To pack everything in a tarball, type
      </p>
      <pre>
tar -cvf bibledit.tar .bibledit
</pre>
      <p>
        Then compress the tarball:
      </p>
      <pre>
gzip bibledit.tar
</pre>
      <p>
        The resulting file is named bibledit.tar.gz and can be attached to the bug report.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the problem is not a segmentation fault, but it shows nothing at all, then the bibledit.log file might give a clue. It is in the <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/bibledit/gtk/4-management/data">temporary directory</a>. View the logfile to see what went wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you try to start bibledit, and a warning comes up that says that Bibledit is already running, then it means that Bibledit already runs somehow. Try switching to that instance of Bibledit that already runs. Or reboot. Or else open a terminal and type "killalll bibledit-bin".

      </h4>
      <p>
        Question: I am completely stopped in my work. I opened a project, but the book of Philemon freezes Bibledit completely. When restarting it, the screen comes up, but none of the menus or buttons work. I cannot scroll. The only button that works is the one to exit the program (which brings up a box giving me the option to force-quit).
      </p>
      <p>
        Answer: You can change the project from the commandline. In a terminal, type this:
      </p>
      <pre>
bibledit --general-configuration --write --key project --value testproject
</pre>
      <p>
        Next time you start Bibledit, it will open project "testproject" - any name will do here.
      </p>
      <p>
        To change the whole configuration to default values type:
      </p>
      <pre>
bibledit --general-configuration --reset
</pre>

      <p>
        When Bibledit is running on Windows, FLEx won't start. While FLEx runs, Bibledit will only start after a long delay due to a timeout. It won't have clipboard functionality. The problem is being looked into. The current workaround is to start FLEx first, and after that Bibledit. Alternatively you can start Cygwin's terminal through the Cygwin icon in the Bibledit menu, and in that terminal type "startx", and then "bibledit".

      </h4>
      <p>
        Bibledit uses iconv, the standard utility on Linux to convert between various encodings.
      </p>
      <p>
        Iconv supports a huge amount of standard encodings. Iconv does the same functions as TECkit does.
      </p>
      <p>
        Bibledit does not at present support a TECkit map, but that is going to change in the future.
      </p>
      <p>
        At conversion time the user sees how the text is going to look, and can change encodings until the result looks right. If there are a couple of characters not right, the search/replace functionality quickly fixes that.

        <a name="thefootnotecallerisdetachedfromtheworditbelongsto" href="" id="thefootnotecallerisdetachedfromtheworditbelongsto"></a>The footnote caller is detached from the word it belongs to
      </h4>
      <p>
        If the USFM code is properly written, the footnote or crossreference caller is always connected to the word it belongs to.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is an example of proper code:
      </p>
      <pre>
Joseph was a good man\f + \ft Or “kind man”.\f*
</pre>
      <p>
        The following two examples of code will cause the footnote caller to detach from the word it belongs to:
      </p>
      <p>
        Example one:
      </p>
      <pre>
Joseph was a good man \f + \ft Or “kind man”.\f*
</pre>
      <p>
        Note the space between "man" and the "\f".
      </p>
      <p>
        Example two:
      </p>
      <pre>
Joseph was a good man<br />\f + \ft Or “kind man”.\f*
</pre>
      <p>
        In USFM a new line is equal to a space, hence there is a space between "man" and the "\f" here also.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many older projects started a new line for each marker, also for the footnotes. This needs correction in the current system. All note markers (footnotes and cross-references) should not start on a new line, but follow immediately the word it belongs to (without even a space).
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that in newer versions of Bibledit the \f ... code for footnotes is no longer visible - only the note itself is visible.
      </p>
      <h4>
        <a name="thefootnotecallertouchesthenextword" href="" id="thefootnotecallertouchesthenextword"></a>The footnote caller touches the next word
      </h4>
      <p>
        If the caller at the bottom of the page touches the footnote text, then you can increase the left margin of the footnote text. In the stylesheet editor, edit the left margin of the Text, marker \ft, and if necessary also for the Paragraph Mark, marker \fp.
      </p>
      <p>
        Same applies to the Crossreferences. Make the setting under marker \xt.

        This may occur in case Adobe Reader has a document loaded already. A subsequent document, printed by Bibledit, may not load in the Reader. Newer versions of the Reader do not have this problem.

        <a name="bartdoesnotscrollwithbibledit" href="" id="bartdoesnotscrollwithbibledit"></a>BART does not scroll with Bibledit
      </h4>
      <p>
        There can be various causes for this.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cause 1. Has Bibledit Windows Outpost been installed?
      </p>
      <p>
        Cause 2: Does it say "Windows Outpost: Connected" in the logfile?
      </p>
      <p>
        Cause 3. When BART runs under Wine, did you install Bibledit Windows Outpost in Wine too? Or when you installed BART in CrossOver Office, e.g. bottle "win98", did you install the Outpost in the same bottle too? The wine installation constitutes a separate Windows machine, and each bottle in CrossOver Office also constitute each their own Windows machines. The system BART uses for scrolling requires that it be accessed from the same Windows machine. This means that if you installed BART in a certain bottle in CrossOver Office, e.g. bottle "win98", then for scrolling to work, the Outpost needs to be installed in that same bottle too.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cause 4: Did you set BART to receive references?
      </p>
      <p>
        Cause 5: If you used CrossOver Office instead of Wine, then you need to start the Outpost manually through the CrossOver menu. It needs to be started each time before you start Bibledit.

      <p>
        Read some more info on <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/bibledit/system/errors/NodeNotFound?suri=wuid:gx:4e51bd63b0b3ac6" class="disabled">BibleTime</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        View the Logfile in the Help menu to ensure that there is a line that says "BibleTime: Connected", and that there are no "BibleTime: " lines saying anything wrong. If everything is right, then scrolling should occur.
      </p>
      <p>
        Bibledit uses "dcop" to send scrolling commands to BibleTime. This can be seen working by ticking menu Preferences / Debug. Then go to another verse, view the logfile, and see a "BibleTime: dcop ..." command there. If this command is there, then Bibledit's job has been done, and if there is still no scrolling, the problem lies with either dcop or BibleTime. You can verify this by executing the dcop command from a terminal and see whether BibleTime scrolls, e.g. by typing
      </p>
      <pre>
dcop bibletime BibleTimeInterface syncAllVerseBasedModules 3John.1.8

      </h4>
      <p>
        Some points to check:
      </p>
      <p>
        1. Ensure in the Windows Outpost preferences that Bibledit can contact the other host.
      </p>
      <p>
        2. Did you start the Outpost manually on the other host? Bibledit won't be able to start it over the network, hence Outpost needs to be started manually.
      </p>
      <p>
        3. Bibledit uses port 51515 to contact the Outpost. Ensure that this port is opened in your firewall on Windows. If this port is closed, Bibledit can't communicate with the Outpost.

      </h4>
      <p>
        The SWORD compiler is part of the SWORD API. Bibledit uses this compiler to export a project to SWORD format.
      </p>
      <p>
        The most likely problem is that you did not install SWORD from source, but from a binary package. Binary packages do not always install the compiler. If you install SWORD from source, or install the development version of libsword the compiler will be installed too.
      </p>
      <p>
        The compiler used is a program called osis2mod. If the compiler has been installed, but Bibledit still cannot find it, the problem might be that the compiler has not been installed in the program search path. Type
      </p>
      <pre>
echo $PATH

      <p>
        in a terminal to see the program search path.

      </h4>
      <p>
        All text between the speech markers disappears when exporting to SWORD. E.g.
      </p>
      <pre>
And Jesus said: &lt;&lt;I am he&gt;&gt;.
</pre>
      <p>
        Everything between &lt;&lt; and &gt;&gt; disappears.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is a bug in the current SWORD compiler. The bug has been reported.
      </p>
      <p>
        A workaround is to use the Unicode speech markers, e.g.
      </p>
      <pre>
And Jesus said: «I am he».

      <p>
        SWORD currently does not support segmented verses, like verse 1a. To prevent problems Bibledit just takes any "a" or "b" out from the verse. SWORD needs to be updated to support this.

        Question: I have used the \mi formatting in the list of names in Acts 13:1. The output to BibleTime lists the \mi paragraphs on separate lines, but the font is changed from my default font for that language, and there is no indenting. Under the form for editing the style for \mi, I don't see a place to select the font. And the default indenting of each line at 6 mm from the left seems right. So is this a problem of what Bibletime can display? (That might explain the lack of indenting, but it seems that the font should not change.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Answer: For any marker, not only the \mi one, the output Bibledit generates for the Sword compiler can be seen in the <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/bibledit/gtk/4-management/data">temporary directory</a>/sword_osis_input.txt. In this case, that of the \mi marker, it can be seen that no indenting information is passed to BibleTime, nor any font information.
      </p>
      <p>
        This implies that the font problem is a problem of BibleTime, and that the indenting is not done because it does not get the information needed. If somebody knows how to pass indenting information to BibleTime, pls. let the programmer of Bibledit know and he can put that information in.

        Reply: This is not an issue with Bibledit, but with the Pango library Bibledit is using. Most likely you are using a font that Pango has a problem with. Problems with Pango can be reported at <a href="http://www.pango.org/" rel="nofollow">www.pango.org</a>.

        Reply: This happens after Bibledit crashed and is restarted after that. The internal webserver cannot function properly because the previous one is still running. To solve the problem, quit and start Bibledit once more. It is hoped that as from Bibledit version 4.1 the internal webserver will have been replaced by a proper webserver such as Apache.

        Question: How can I print the digits in Farsi script?
      </p>
      <p>
        Answer: According to the USFM standard one can use the \cp marker to print a different number for the chapter number. And one can use the \vp markup to do the same for the verse. But this is not well supported by Bibledit. XeTeX has a "font mapping" option that allows a Unicode-&gt;Unicode TECkit mapping table to be associated with a font; by using such a mapping that converts Latindigits to Farsi ones, the \c numbers can be printed in the desired numeral system without any special preparation needed in the USFM file, and similarly for \v, page numbers, cross-references, anywhere you might want to apply it.<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        To get this to work in Bibledit, the following is important. On Debian and derivatives such as Ubuntu, install package "texlive-lang-arab" and font "ttf-sil-scheherazade". The Arab package provides the TECkit mapping with the Farsi digits conversion, and the font package provides a font that has been proven to work with XeTeX. Other fonts might work as well. Once these two packages have been installed, open the Farsi text in Bibledit, and set the Arabic font in the View menu, so that the text in the editor is real Farsi. The press Ctrl-P to print, and choose the option to print via de pdf2ptx typesetter. In the Print Settings window, choose Options, and switch to the Mapping tab. Select file "farsidigits.tec". If the Arab package was installed properly, then this TECkit mapping will be available in folder /usr/share/texmf-texlive/fonts/misc/xetex/fontmapping/polyglossia. After pressing OK, everything should work out well, and after some time the Farsi document should show up. It is important to choose the "arab" shaping engine, so that the letters and words are properly spaced. On Ubuntu there is a package called ttf-farsiweb which may have good fonts. A font called Nazli gave good results.<br />
