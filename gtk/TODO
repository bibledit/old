The features that you feel Bibledit-Gtk ought to have become todo items.

I'd like to put out a call for patches implementing the todo items.


These are bug fixes or speed enhancements or features that we believe
are worthy of someone's attention to improve bibledit-gtk. For
additional information, please contact Pastor Matt Postiff
<postiffm@umich.edu> or Birch Champeon <birch@birchandconnie.com>.

Roughly in order of priority

Date Added Description
1/12/2015  Fix Settings:: and ProjectConfiguration:: to have a "SaveSettings"
	   routine or some such so that they do NOT save state in their 
	   destructors.
1/12/2015  Keyterms and related verses window is VERY slow to update when you
	   change verses.
1/12/2015  Fix Mappings::original2me because it takes a lot of time.
1/13/2015  Fix #pragma warning in Windows compile
1/13/2015  Fix duplication #define of WIN32 in Windows compile, probably by
	   protecting the definition in config.h.in.
1/13/2015  It is not clear that gtk/config.h should be tracked in git
           because it changes with every ./configure call. Probably only
	   config.h.in should be tracked.
