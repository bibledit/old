<h2><?php echo Locale_Translate::_("Introduction") ?></h2>
<p>
 <?php echo Locale_Translate::_("What is Scrum-based translation?") ?>
 <?php echo Locale_Translate::_("A translation team that works with Scrum frequently releases portions of translated Scripture.") ?>
 <?php echo Locale_Translate::_("This makes it clear to involved parties where the translation project is going.") ?>
 <?php echo Locale_Translate::_("It enables the translation team to make course corrections based on the facts.") ?>
 <?php echo Locale_Translate::_("Burndown charts and the product backlog provide the product owner and others with a permanent overview over the translation status and progress.") ?>
 <?php echo Locale_Translate::_("Scrum is an agile process that enables self-organizing translation teams to deliver high translation output and accuracy in a short time.") ?>
 <?php echo Locale_Translate::_("Using iterative translation, it releases portions of translated Scripture every iteration, that is, every month.") ?>
 <?php echo Locale_Translate::_("At the end of the every sprint, anyone can see the translated portion, and decide whether to release it to the congregations and community for feedback or continue to enhance it.") ?>
</p>
<br>
<p>
 <?php echo Locale_Translate::_("The introduction and the following explanation just outlines the mechanics of Scrum-based Translation.") ?>
 <?php echo Locale_Translate::_("It does not make clear what difficulties and issues you will run into trying to implement it.") ?>
 <?php echo Locale_Translate::_("It only hints at the agile spirit that's required to make it work.") ?>
 <?php echo Locale_Translate::_("If you're interested in implementing Scrum-based translation, do some reading, watch videos, follow a course, find a mentor or coach.") ?>
</p>
<h2><?php echo Locale_Translate::_("Product Owner") ?></h2>
<p>
 <?php echo Locale_Translate::_("The Product Owner represents the stakeholders.") ?>
 <?php echo Locale_Translate::_("He or she is the voice of the target audience, that is the Bible reader.") ?>
 <?php echo Locale_Translate::_("He understands the requirements for the Bible.") ?>
 <?php echo Locale_Translate::_("The Product Owner may also be a group of people in a committee.") ?>
</p>
<br>
<p>
 <?php echo Locale_Translate::_("He is responsible for ensuring that the team delivers accuracy and reliability to the Bible translation.") ?>
 <?php echo Locale_Translate::_("He knows about accuracy and reliability.") ?>
</p>
<br>
<p>
 <?php echo Locale_Translate::_("He defines items that focus on desired features.") ?>
 <?php echo Locale_Translate::_("He makes decisions as to whether to implement footnotes or leave them out.") ?>
 <?php echo Locale_Translate::_("In the same way, he defines other features, like headers, introductions, or decides to leave them out.") ?>
 <?php echo Locale_Translate::_("He decides about use or non-use of a dialect.") ?>
</p>
<br>
<p>
 <?php echo Locale_Translate::_("He sets the priorities for the work to be done.") ?>
 <?php echo Locale_Translate::_("He adds the items to the product backlog.") ?>
</p>
<br>
<p>
 <?php echo Locale_Translate::_("Scrum teams should have one Product Owner.") ?>
 <?php echo Locale_Translate::_("The Product Owner may be part of the Translation Team, but it is recommended that his role not be combined with the role of Scrum Master.") ?>
</p>

<h2><?php echo Locale_Translate::_("Release Planning") ?></h2>
<p>
 <?php echo Locale_Translate::_("The release planning shows which parts of the Bible will be translated and delivered during which Sprint.") ?>
 <?php echo Locale_Translate::_("It is convenient to define a Sprint in months, so that the release planning mentions January, February, and so on.") ?>
</p>
<br>
<p>
 <?php echo Locale_Translate::_("It is often helpful to stick the release planning to the wall so that everybody can see the grand picture.") ?>
</p>
<br>
<p><?php echo Locale_Translate::_("The advantages of a release planning are:") ?></p>
<p><?php echo Locale_Translate::_("1. It gives the team a common vision about what needs to be achieved, and when.") ?></p>
<p><?php echo Locale_Translate::_("2. It guides the team to make decisions during detailed planning.") ?></p>
<p><?php echo Locale_Translate::_("3. It helps prioritize the actions.") ?></p>
<p><?php echo Locale_Translate::_("4. It resolves conflicts and guides the teams toward the right balance on trade-offs.") ?></p>
<br>
<p>
 <?php echo Locale_Translate::_("Release each completed Bible book to the community and get their feedback.") ?>
 <?php echo Locale_Translate::_("This implements the important principle of continual improvement.") ?>
</p>
<br>
<p>
  <?php echo Locale_Translate::_("The release planning is a simple way of doing top-down planning.") ?>
  <?php echo Locale_Translate::_("It is an estimate, simple and quick to do.") ?>
  <?php echo Locale_Translate::_("It is based on the Product Backlog.") ?>
</p>

<h2><?php echo Locale_Translate::_("Product Backlog") ?></h2>
<p>
  <?php echo Locale_Translate::_("The product backlog is an ordered list of requirements that is maintained for the Bible translation.") ?>
  <?php echo Locale_Translate::_("It consists of translation tasks, checking tasks, testing tasks, comprehension tasks, whatever needs to be done to deliver a reliable manuscript.") ?>
</p>
<p>
  <?php echo Locale_Translate::_("The Product Owner prioritizes the items on this list.") ?>
  <?php echo Locale_Translate::_("It is used to determine the work for the next sprints.") ?>
  <?php echo Locale_Translate::_("Each item has an associated estimated time to complete.") ?>
</p>

<h2><?php echo Locale_Translate::_("Sprint") ?></h2>
<p>
 <?php echo Locale_Translate::_("A sprint typically takes one month.") ?>
</p>
<br>
<p>
 <?php echo Locale_Translate::_("This is where the translaton work (translate, review, approve, test) occurs.") ?>
</p>
<br>
<p>
 <?php echo Locale_Translate::_("Each member of the team translates independently and in a responsible manner.") ?>
 <?php echo Locale_Translate::_("In case a translator is sure of a required change, he enters it without consulting others.") ?>
 <?php echo Locale_Translate::_("If a translator thinks a proposed change needs discussion, he notifies his colleagues.") ?>
</p>
<br>
<p>
 <?php echo Locale_Translate::_("All members of the translation team review the changes made by the team.") ?>
 <?php echo Locale_Translate::_("This is to make sure that all changes are reviewed by all members, that no mistakes occur.") ?>
 <?php echo Locale_Translate::_("The reviews take place every day.") ?>
</p>
<br>
<p>
 <?php echo Locale_Translate::_("This way of working is based on personal responsibility and mutual trust.") ?>
 <?php echo Locale_Translate::_("It speeds up the translation procedure because there's more actual translation work going on, and less discussions.") ?>
 <?php echo Locale_Translate::_("The newer members of the team learn from the more experienced ones through the daily reviews.") ?>
</p>
<br>
<p>
 <?php echo Locale_Translate::_("Bibledit-Web has the concept of daily Change Notifications.") ?>
 <?php echo Locale_Translate::_("A member can opt to receive the Change Notifications through email.") ?>
 <?php echo Locale_Translate::_("This email can be viewed online also.") ?>
 <?php echo Locale_Translate::_("Or a member can opt to have the Change Notifications generated for him online, and can review and approve them there.") ?>
</p>

<h2><?php echo Locale_Translate::_("Sprint Planning Meeting") ?></h2>
<p><?php echo Locale_Translate::_("During this meeting the team selects the portions to translate, review and test it believes it can commit to in a sprint.") ?></p>
<p><?php echo Locale_Translate::_("The team breaks the portions down into tasks and provided estimates for those tasks as to the time it takes to complete them.") ?></p>

<h2><?php echo Locale_Translate::_("Sprint Backlog") ?></h2>
<p>
  <?php echo Locale_Translate::_("The sprint backlog is a list of tasks to be completed in a sprint.") ?>
  <?php echo Locale_Translate::_("The tasks are created by breaking down the product backlog items during the planning meeting.") ?></p>
  <?php echo Locale_Translate::_("The tasks have estimates in hours or days associated with them.") ?>
</p>
<br>
<p>
 <?php echo Locale_Translate::_("For a team it is vitally important to have a clear goal to work towards.") ?>
 <?php echo Locale_Translate::_("Thus everybody is focused on the desired outcome, and keeps a good pace.") ?>
 <?php echo Locale_Translate::_("Without a clear goal, the team may still do a lot of things and work hard, but the produced results may have the desired value.") ?>
</p>

<h2><?php echo Locale_Translate::_("Team") ?></h2>
<p>
  <?php echo Locale_Translate::_("The team consistes of the Bible translators, their assistants, and the consultants.") ?>
</p>
<p>
  <?php echo Locale_Translate::_("The team organizes itself to carry out the work and deliver a reliable and good Bible translation.") ?>
</p>
<p>
  <?php echo Locale_Translate::_("The team is quick but does not hurry.") ?>
  <?php echo Locale_Translate::_("The team goes fast, but always has an eye on translation quality.") ?>
</p>

<h2><?php echo Locale_Translate::_("Scrum Master") ?></h2>
<p>
  <?php echo Locale_Translate::_("The scrum master organizes the translation process.") ?>
</p>
<p>
  <?php echo Locale_Translate::_("He or she keeps track of the progress of the translation team.") ?>
</p>
<p>
  <?php echo Locale_Translate::_("He removes obstacles from the path of the team.") ?>
</p>

<h2><?php echo Locale_Translate::_("Daily Scrum Meeting") ?></h2>
<p>
 <?php echo Locale_Translate::_("On each day of a sprint, the Bible translation team holds daily meetings.") ?>
 <?php echo Locale_Translate::_("These meetings are called: Daily scrum meetings.") ?>
 <?php echo Locale_Translate::_("The scrum meetings are held in the same place and at the same time.") ?>
 <?php echo Locale_Translate::_("The meetings are typically held in front of Task Board.") ?>
 <?php echo Locale_Translate::_("The daily scrum meeting is best held in the morning, because it assists in setting the context for the work of that day.") ?>
 <?php echo Locale_Translate::_("During the meeting, all members stand, as this keeps the discussion short and relevant.") ?>
 <?php echo Locale_Translate::_("The scrum meeting is strictly time-boxed to 15 minutes.") ?>
</p>
<br>
<p>
 <?php echo Locale_Translate::_("There is a difference between people who are 'committed' to the Bible translation project, and those who are 'involved' in it.") ?>
 <?php echo Locale_Translate::_("Scrum affords special status to those who are committed.") ?>
 <?php echo Locale_Translate::_("Many teams enforce a rule in which only those who are committed are allowed to talk during the daily scrum meeting.") ?>
</p>
<br>
<p>
 <?php echo Locale_Translate::_("All team members are required to attend the scrum meetings.") ?>
 <?php echo Locale_Translate::_("The Scrum Master and the and Product Owner (usually the Bible Translation Manager) are committed team members.") ?>
 <?php echo Locale_Translate::_("They are expected to attend and participate.") ?>
 <?php echo Locale_Translate::_("Anyone else, for example a Church leader, a Committee member, or a Translator from another team, is allowed to attend but is there to listen only.") ?>
 <?php echo Locale_Translate::_("This makes the daily scrum meeting an excellent way for a scrum team to disseminate information.") ?>
 <?php echo Locale_Translate::_("If you are interested in hearing the status of the project, attend that day's meeting.") ?>
</p>
<br>
<p>
 <?php echo Locale_Translate::_("The scrum meeting is not the place for solving problems or resolving issues.") ?>
 <?php echo Locale_Translate::_("Issues that are raised are usually dealt with by one or two team members immediately after the scrum.") ?>
</p>
<br>
<p><?php echo Locale_Translate::_("During the daily Scrum, each team member answers the following three questions:") ?></p>
<p>1. <?php echo Locale_Translate::_("What did you do yesterday?") ?></p>
<p>2. <?php echo Locale_Translate::_("What are you going to do today?") ?></p>
<p>3. <?php echo Locale_Translate::_("Are there any impediments in your way?") ?></p>
<p><?php echo Locale_Translate::_("The Scrum Master asks each team member to answer these questions, the member speaks, the Scrum Master thanks the member, and then goes to the next member.") ?></p>
<br>
<p>
 <?php echo Locale_Translate::_("By focusing on what each person did yesterday and will do today, the team gains an understanding of what work has been done and what work remains.") ?>
 <?php echo Locale_Translate::_("The daily scrum meeting is not a status update meeting in which the boss is finding out about who is slow in his work.") ?>
 <?php echo Locale_Translate::_("Rather, it is a meeting in which team members make commitments to each other.") ?>
 <?php echo Locale_Translate::_("If a translator says: Today, I will prepare chapter 10 and 11 of Matthew, everyone knows that in tomorrow's meeting, he will say whether or not he did finish.") ?>
 <?php echo Locale_Translate::_("This has the wonderful effect of helping a team realize the significance of these commitments, and that their commitments are to each other, and not to anyone else.") ?>
</p>
<br>
<p>
 <?php echo Locale_Translate::_("Any impediments that are raised in the daily scrums become the Scrum Master's responsibility to resolve as quickly as possible.") ?>
 <?php echo Locale_Translate::_("Typical impediments are:") ?>
</p>
<p>1. <?php echo Locale_Translate::_("My ... broke and I need a new one today.") ?></p>
<p>2. <?php echo Locale_Translate::_("I still haven't got the ... I requested a month ago.") ?></p>
<p>3. <?php echo Locale_Translate::_("I'm struggling to understand ... and would like to discuss it with someone.") ?></p>
<p>4. <?php echo Locale_Translate::_("The ... has asked me to work on something else for a few days.") ?></p>
<p>
 <?php echo Locale_Translate::_("In cases where the Scrum Master cannot remove these impediments directly himself, he still takes responsibility for making sure someone on the team does quickly resolve the issue.") ?>
</p>
<br>
<p>
 <?php echo Locale_Translate::_("Every day a different person leads the daily scrum meeting.") ?>
 <?php echo Locale_Translate::_("This gets the entire team involved.") ?>
 <?php echo Locale_Translate::_("It opens up new channels for communication.") ?>
 <?php echo Locale_Translate::_("It builds trust between the Translators and the Scrum Master.") ?>
 <?php echo Locale_Translate::_("Team members can learn from one another's techniques.") ?>
 <?php echo Locale_Translate::_("The Scrum Master ensures to set a good example for leading the daily scrum meeting.") ?>
</p>
<br>
<p>
  <?php echo Locale_Translate::_("The scrum master uses the information from the meeting to update the burndown chart illustrating progress.") ?>
</p>
<br>
<p>
  <?php echo Locale_Translate::_("Side conversations are taken offline.") ?>
</p>
<br>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stand-up_meeting" target="_blank"><?php echo Locale_Translate::_("External reference") ?></a></p>

<h2><?php echo Locale_Translate::_("Burn down chart") ?></h2>
<p>
 <?php echo Locale_Translate::_("A burn down chart is a graphical representation of work left to do versus time.") ?>
 <?php echo Locale_Translate::_("The outstanding work is on the vertical axis.") ?>
 <?php echo Locale_Translate::_("The days of the sprint are on the horizontal axis.") ?>
 <?php echo Locale_Translate::_("It is useful for predicting when all of the work will be completed.") ?>
</p>
<br>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burn_down_chart" target="_blank"><?php echo Locale_Translate::_("External reference") ?></a></p>

<h2><?php echo Locale_Translate::_("Sprint Review") ?></h2>
<p><?php echo Locale_Translate::_("The Product Owner looks through the sprint’s work and provides feedback.") ?></p>
<p><?php echo Locale_Translate::_("The Translators may demonstrate features.") ?></p>
<p><?php echo Locale_Translate::_("The Team owns up to deficiencies with the translation, helping to build trust with the Product Owner.") ?></p>

<h2><?php echo Locale_Translate::_("Sprint Retrospective") ?></h2>
<p><?php echo Locale_Translate::_("The Team reviews what went well and what went poorly.") ?></p>
<p><?php echo Locale_Translate::_("They use retrospection techniques to find potential for improvement.") ?></p>
<p><?php echo Locale_Translate::_("They pick one or two areas to focus for improvement.") ?></p>
