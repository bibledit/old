\c 1  
\p
\v 1  In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. 
\v 2  And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness \add was\add*
upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face
of the waters. 
\p
\v 3  And God said, Let there be light: and there was light. 
\v 4  And God saw the light, that \add it was\add* good: and God
divided the light from the darkness.\f +  \ft the light from…: Heb. between the light and between the
darkness\f* 
\v 5  And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night.
And the evening and the morning were the first day.\f +  \ft And the evening…: Heb. And the evening was, and the morning was
etc.\f* 
\p
\v 6 ¶ And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the
waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.\f +  \ft firmament: Heb.
expansion\f* 
\v 7  And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which \add were\add*
under the firmament from the waters which \add were\add* above the
firmament: and it was so. 
\v 8  And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the
morning were the second day.\f +  \ft And the evening…: Heb. And the evening was, and the morning was
etc.\f* 
\p
\v 9 ¶ And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered
together unto one place, and let the dry \add land\add* appear: and it was so.
\v 10  And God called the dry \add land\add* Earth; and the gathering
together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that \add it was\add*
good. 
\v 11  And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding
seed, \add and\add* the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind,
whose seed \add is\add* in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.\f + 
\ft grass: Heb. tender grass\f* 
\v 12  And the earth brought forth grass, \add and\add* herb yielding
seed after his kind, and the tree yielding  fruit, whose seed \add was\add*
in itself, after his kind: and God saw that \add it was\add* good.
\v 13  And the evening and the morning were the third day.\f +  \ft And the evening…: Heb. And the evening was, and the morning
was etc.\f* 
\p
\v 14 ¶ And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the
heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs,
and for seasons, and for days, and years:\f +  \ft the day…: Heb. between the day and between the
night\f* 
\v 15  And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven
to give light upon the earth: and it was so. 
\v 16  And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the
day, and the lesser light to rule the night: \add he made\add* the
stars also.\f +  \ft to rule the day…: Heb. for the rule of the day,
etc.\f* 
\v 17  And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light
upon the earth, 
\v 18  And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide
the light from the darkness: and God saw that \add it was\add* good.
\v 19  And the evening and the morning were the fourth day.\f + 
\ft And the evening…: Heb. And the evening was, and the morning was
etc.\f* 
\p
\v 20  And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving
creature that hath life, and fowl \add that\add* may fly above the
earth in the open firmament of heaven.\f +  \ft moving: or, creeping\f*\f + 
\ft life: Heb. soul\f*\f +  \ft fowl…: Heb. let fowl fly\f*\f + 
\ft open…: Heb. face of the firmament of heaven\f* 
\v 21  And God created great whales, and every living creature that
moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind,
and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that \add it was\add*
good. 
\v 22  And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and
fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply  in the earth.
\v 23  And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.\f +  \ft And the evening…: Heb. And the evening was, and the morning
was etc.\f* 
\p
\v 24 ¶ And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature
after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth
after his kind: and it was so. 
\v 25  And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle
after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his
kind: and God saw that \add it was\add* good. 
\p
\v 26 ¶ And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness:
and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the
fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping
thing that creepeth upon the earth. 
\v 27  So God created man in his \add own\add* image, in the image
of God created he him; male and female created he them. 
\v 28  And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful,
and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion
over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living
thing that moveth upon the earth.\f +  \ft moveth: Heb. creepeth\f*
\p
\v 29 ¶ And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing
 seed, which \add is\add* upon the face of all the earth, and every
tree, in the which \add is\add* the fruit of a tree yielding seed;
to you it shall be for meat.\f +  \ft bearing…: Heb. seeding seed\f*\f + 
\ft yielding…: Heb. seeding seed\f* 
\v 30  And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the
air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein \add there
is\add* life, \add I have given\add* every green herb for meat: and it was
so.\f +  \ft life: Heb. a living soul\f* 
\v 31  And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, \add it
was\add* very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth
day.\f +  \ft And the evening…: Heb. And the evening was, and the morning was
etc.\f* 
\c 2  
\p
\v 1  Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of
them. 
\v 2  And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made;
and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.
\v 3  And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because
that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and
made.\f +  \ft created…: Heb. created to make\f* 
\p
\v 4 ¶ These \add are\add* the generations of the heavens and of the
earth when they were created, in the day that the \nd LORD\nd* God
made the earth and the heavens, 
\v 5  And every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every
herb of the field before it grew: for the \nd LORD\nd* God had not
caused it to rain upon the earth, and \add there was\add* not a man
to till the ground. 
\v 6  But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole
face of the ground.\f +  \ft there…: or, a mist which went up from,
etc.\f* 
\v 7  And the \nd LORD\nd* God formed man \add of\add* the dust of
the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and
man became a living soul.\f +  \ft of the dust…: Heb. dust of the
ground\f* 
\p
\v 8 ¶ And the \nd LORD\nd* God planted a garden eastward in Eden;
and there he put the man whom he had formed. 
\v 9  And out of the ground made the \nd LORD\nd* God to grow every
tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of
life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of
good and evil. 
\v 10  And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was
parted, and became into four heads. 
\v 11  The name of the first \add is\add* Pison: that \add is\add*
it which compasseth the whole land of Havilah, where \add there is\add*
gold; 
\v 12  And the gold of that land \add is\add* good: there \add is\add*
bdellium and the onyx stone. 
\v 13  And the name of the second river \add is\add* Gihon: the same
\add is\add* it that compasseth the whole land of Ethiopia.\f + 
\ft Ethiopia: Heb. Cush\f* 
\v 14  And the name of the third river \add is\add* Hiddekel: that
\add is\add* it which goeth toward the east of Assyria. And the fourth
river \add is\add* Euphrates.\f +  \ft toward…: or, eastward to Assyria\f*
\v 15  And the \nd LORD\nd* God took the man, and put him into the
garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it.\f +  \ft the man: or,
Adam\f* 
\p
\v 16  And the \nd LORD\nd* God commanded the man, saying, Of every
tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat:\f +  \ft thou…: Heb. eating thou shalt
eat\f* 
\v 17  But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not
eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely
die.\f +  \ft thou shalt surely…: Heb. dying thou shalt die\f* 
\p
\v 18 ¶ And the \nd LORD\nd* God said, \add It is\add* not good that the
man should be alone; I will make him an help meet for him.\f +  \ft meet…: Heb. as before
him\f* 
\v 19  And out of the ground the \nd LORD\nd* God formed every beast
of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought \add them\add*
unto Adam to see what he would call them: and whatsoever Adam called
every living creature, that \add was\add* the name thereof.\f + 
\ft Adam: or, the man\f* 
\v 20  And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the
air, and to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not
found an help meet for him.\f +  \ft gave: Heb. called\f* 
\p
\v 21  And the \nd LORD\nd* God caused a deep sleep to fall upon
Adam, and he slept: and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the
flesh instead thereof; 
\v 22  And the rib, which the \nd LORD\nd* God had taken from man,
made he a woman, and brought her unto the man.\f +  \ft made: Heb.
builded\f* 
\v 23  And Adam said, This \add is\add* now bone of my bones, and
flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken
out of Man.\f +  \ft Woman: Heb. Isha\f*\f +  \ft Man: Heb. Ish\f*
\v 24  Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall
cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh. 
\v 25  And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not
ashamed. 
\c 3  
\p
\v 1  Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field
which the \nd LORD\nd* God had made. And he said unto the woman,
Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?\f + 
\ft Yea…: Heb. Yea, because, etc.\f* 
\v 2  And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit
of the trees of the garden: 
\v 3  But of the fruit of the tree which \add is\add* in the midst
of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye
touch it, lest ye die. 
\v 4  And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die:
\v 5  For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your
eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.
\p
\v 6  And when the woman saw that the tree \add was\add* good for
food, and that it \add was\add* pleasant to the eyes, and a tree
to be desired to make \add one\add* wise, she took of the fruit thereof,
and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did
eat.\f +  \ft pleasant: Heb. a desire\f* 
\v 7  And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they
\add were\add* naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made
themselves aprons.\f +  \ft aprons: or, things to gird about\f* 
\v 8  And they heard the voice of the \nd LORD\nd* God walking in the
garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves
from the presence of the \nd LORD\nd* God amongst the trees of the
garden.\f +  \ft cool: Heb. wind\f* 
\p
\v 9  And the \nd LORD\nd* God called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where
\add art\add* thou? 
\v 10  And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid,
because I \add was\add* naked; and I hid myself. 
\p
\v 11  And he said, Who told thee that thou \add wast\add* naked?
Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest
not eat? 
\v 12  And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest \add to be\add*
with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat. 
\v 13  And the \nd LORD\nd* God said unto the woman, What \add is\add* this
\add that\add* thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled
me, and I did eat. 
\p
\v 14  And the \nd LORD\nd* God said unto the serpent, Because thou
hast done this, thou \add art\add* cursed above all cattle, and above every
beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou
eat all the days of thy life: 
\v 15  And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy
seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise
his heel. 
\v 16  Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow
and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy
desire \add shall be\add* to thy husband, and he shall rule over
thee.\f +  \ft to thy…: or, subject to thy husband\f* 
\p
\v 17  And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the
voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded
thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed \add is\add* the ground
for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat \add of\add* it all the days
of thy life; 
\v 18  Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt
eat the herb of the field;\f +  \ft bring…: Heb. cause to bud\f*
\v 19  In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return
unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou \add art\add*,
and unto dust shalt thou return. 
\v 20  And Adam called his wife’s name Eve; because she was the mother
of all living.\f +  \ft Eve: Heb. Chavah: that is Living\f* 
\v 21  Unto Adam also and to his wife did the \nd LORD\nd* God make
coats of skins, and clothed them. 
\p
\v 22 ¶ And the \nd LORD\nd* God said, Behold, the man is become as
one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his
hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:
\v 23  Therefore the \nd LORD\nd* God sent him forth from the garden
of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken. 
\v 24  So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the
garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every
way, to keep the way of the tree of life. 
\c 4  
\p
\v 1  And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain,
and said, I have gotten a man from the \nd LORD\nd*.\f +  \ft Cain: that is, Gotten, or,
Acquired\f* 
\v 2  And she again bare his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper
of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.\f +  \ft Abel: Heb.
Hebel\f*\f +  \ft a keeper: Heb. a feeder\f* 
\p
\v 3  And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the
fruit of the ground an offering unto the \nd LORD\nd*.\f +  \ft in process…: Heb. at the end of
days\f* 
\v 4  And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the
fat thereof. And the \nd LORD\nd* had respect unto Abel and to his
offering:\f +  \ft flock: Heb. sheep, or, goats\f* 
\v 5  But unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain
was very wroth, and his countenance fell. 
\p
\v 6  And the \nd LORD\nd* said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy
countenance fallen? 
\v 7  If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest not
well, sin lieth at the door. And unto thee \add shall be\add* his
desire, and thou shalt rule over him.\f +  \ft be accepted: or, have the
excellency\f*\f +  \ft unto…: or, subject unto thee\f* 
\v 8  And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came to pass, when they were in the
field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him.
\p
\v 9 ¶ And the \nd LORD\nd* said unto Cain, Where \add is\add* Abel
thy brother? And he said, I know not: \add Am\add* I my brother’s
keeper? 
\v 10  And he said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother’s
blood crieth unto me from the ground.\f +  \ft blood: Heb. bloods\f*
\v 11 And now \add art\add* thou cursed from the earth, which hath
opened her mouth to receive thy brother’s blood from thy hand; 
\v 12  When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield
unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the
earth. 
\p
\v 13  And Cain said unto the \nd LORD\nd*, My punishment \add is\add*
greater than I can bear.\f +  \ft My…: or, Mine iniquity is greater than that it may be
forgiven\f* 
\v 14  Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the
earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive
and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass, \add that\add*
every one that findeth me shall slay me. 
\v 15  And the \nd LORD\nd* said unto him, Therefore whosoever slayeth
Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And the \nd LORD\nd*
set a mark upon Cain, lest any finding him should kill him. 
\p
\v 16 ¶ And Cain went out from the presence of the \nd LORD\nd*,
and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden. 
\v 17  And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare Enoch:
and he builded a city, and called the name of the city, after the
name of his son, Enoch.\f +  \ft Enoch: Heb. Chanoch\f* 
\v 18  And unto Enoch was born Irad: and Irad begat Mehujael: and

\p
\v 19 ¶ And Lamech took unto him two wives: the name of the one \add was\add*

\v 20  And Adah bare Jabal: he was the father of such as dwell in
tents, and \add of such as have\add* cattle. 
\v 21  And his brother’s name \add was\add* Jubal: he was the father
of all such as handle the harp and organ. 
\v 22  And Zillah, she also bare Tubal-cain, an instructer of every
artificer in brass and iron: and the sister of Tubal-cain \add was\add*
Naamah.\f +  \ft instructer: Heb. whetter\f* 
\p
\v 23  And Lamech said unto his wives, Adah and Zillah, Hear my voice;

to my wounding, and a young man to my hurt.\f +  \ft I have…: or, I would slay a man in my wound,
etc.\f*\f +  \ft to my hurt: or, in my hurt\f* 
\v 24  If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy and

\v 25 ¶ And Adam knew his wife again; and she bare a son, and called
his name Seth: For God, \add said she\add*, hath appointed me another
seed instead of Abel, whom Cain slew.\f +  \ft Seth: Heb. Sheth: that is Appointed, or,

\v 26  And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called

\ft Enos: Heb. Enosh\f*\f +  \ft to call…: or, to call themselves by the name of the

\c 5  
\p
\v 1  This \add is\add* the book of the generations of Adam. In the

\p
\v 3 ¶ And Adam lived an hundred and thirty years, and begat \add a

\v 30  And Lamech lived after he begat Noah five hundred ninety and

\v 32  And Noah was five hundred years old: and Noah begat Shem,

\c 6  
\p
\v 1  And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face
of the earth, and daughters were born unto them, 
\v 2  That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they \add were\add*
fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose. 
\v 3  And the \nd LORD\nd* said, My spirit shall not always strive
with man, for that he also \add is\add* flesh: yet his days shall be an

\p
\v 4  There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after
that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they
bare \add children\add* to them, the same \add became\add* mighty
men which \add were\add* of old, men of renown. 
\p
\v 5 ¶ And \nd GOD\nd* saw that the wickedness of man \add was\add*

\p
\v 6  And it repented the \nd LORD\nd* that he had made man on the

\v 7  And the \nd LORD\nd* said, I will destroy man whom I have created
from the face of the earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping
thing, and the fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that I have
made them.\f +  \ft both…: Heb. from man unto beast\f* 
\p
\v 8  But Noah found grace in the eyes of the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\p
\v 9 ¶ These \add are\add* the generations of Noah: Noah was a just
man \add and\add* perfect in his generations, \add and\add* Noah
walked with God.\f +  \ft perfect: or, upright\f* 
\v 10  And Noah begat three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth. 
\p
\v 11  The earth also was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled

\v 12  And God looked upon the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt;
for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth. 
\p
\v 13  And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before
me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will
destroy them with the earth.\f +  \ft with the earth: or, from the

\v 18  But with thee will I establish my covenant; and thou shalt

wives with thee. 
\v 19  And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every \add sort\add*

\v 22  Thus did Noah; according to all that God commanded him, so
did he. 
\c 7  
\p
\v 1  And the \nd LORD\nd* said unto Noah, Come thou and all thy
house into the ark; for thee have I seen righteous before me in this

\v 2  Of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee by sevens, the

\p
\v 5  And Noah did according unto all that the \nd LORD\nd* commanded him.
\v 6  And Noah \add was\add* six hundred years old when the flood

\p
\v 7 ¶ And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons’
wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood.
\v 8  Of clean beasts, and of beasts that \add are\add* not clean,
and of fowls, and of every thing that creepeth upon the earth, 
\v 9  There went in two and two unto Noah into the ark, the male
and the female, as God had commanded Noah. 
\v 10  And it came to pass after seven days, that the waters of the
flood were upon the earth.\f +  \ft after…: or, on the seventh day\f*
\p
\v 11 ¶ In the six hundredth year of Noah’s life, in the second month,
the seventeenth day of the month, the same day were all the fountains
of the great deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened.\f + 
\ft windows: or, floodgates\f* 
\v 12  And the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights.
\p
\v 13  In the selfsame day entered Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and Japheth,
the sons of Noah, and Noah’s wife, and the three wives of his sons
with them, into the ark; 
\v 14  They, and every beast after his kind, and all the cattle after their
kind, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth after his

\ft sort: Heb. wing\f* 
\v 15  And they went in unto Noah into the ark, two and two of all

\v 16  And they that went in, went in male and female of all flesh,
as God had commanded him: and the \nd LORD\nd* shut him in. 
\p
\v 17  And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters
increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lift up above the earth.
\v 18  And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the
earth; and the ark went upon the face of the waters. 
\v 19  And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the
high hills, that \add were\add* under the whole heaven, were covered.
\v 20  Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail; and the mountains
were covered. 
\p
\v 21  And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl,
and of cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping thing that creepeth
upon the earth, and every man: 
\v 22  All in whose nostrils \add was\add* the breath of life, of all that
\add was\add* in the dry \add land\add*, died.\f +  \ft the breath…: Heb. the breath of the spirit of

\v 23  And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the
face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping things,
and the fowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth:
and Noah only remained \add alive\add*, and they that \add were\add*
with him in the ark. 
\v 24  And the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fifty
days. 
\c 8  
\p
\v 1  And God remembered Noah, and every living thing, and all the
cattle that \add was\add* with him in the ark: and God made a wind
to pass over the earth, and the waters asswaged; 
\v 2  The fountains also of the deep and the windows of heaven were
stopped, and the rain from heaven was restrained; 
\v 3  And the waters returned from off the earth continually: and after the
end of the hundred and fifty days the waters were abated.\f +  \ft continually: Heb. in going and
returning\f* 
\p
\v 4  And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth
day of the month, upon the mountains of Ararat. 
\v 5  And the waters decreased continually until the tenth month:
in the tenth \add month\add*, on the first \add day\add* of the month,
were the tops of the mountains seen.\f +  \ft decreased…: Heb. were in going and

\p
\v 6 ¶ And it came to pass at the end of forty days, that Noah opened
the window of the ark which he had made: 
\v 7  And he sent forth a raven, which went forth to and fro, until the
waters were dried up from off the earth.\f +  \ft to…: Heb. in going forth and
returning\f* 
\v 8  Also he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were
abated from off the face of the ground; 
\v 9  But the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot, and she
returned unto him into the ark, for the waters \add were\add* on the
face of the whole earth: then he put forth his hand, and took her,
and pulled her in unto him into the ark.\f +  \ft pulled…: Heb. caused her to
come\f* 
\v 10  And he stayed yet other seven days; and again he sent forth
the dove out of the ark; 
\v 11  And the dove came in to him in the evening; and, lo, in her
mouth \add was\add* an olive leaf pluckt off: so Noah knew that the
waters were abated from off the earth. 
\v 12  And he stayed yet other seven days; and sent forth the dove;
which returned not again unto him any more. 
\p
\v 13 ¶ And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year,
in the first \add month\add*, the first \add day\add* of the month,
the waters were dried up from off the earth: and Noah removed the
covering of the ark, and looked, and, behold, the face of the ground
was dry. 
\v 14  And in the second month, on the seven and twentieth day of the
month, was the earth dried. 
\p
\v 15 ¶ And God spake unto Noah, saying, 
\v 16  Go forth of the ark, thou, and thy wife, and thy sons, and thy
sons’ wives with thee. 
\v 17  Bring forth with thee every living thing that \add is\add*
with thee, of all flesh, \add both\add* of fowl, and of cattle, and of every creeping
thing that creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed abundantly
in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth. 
\v 18  And Noah went forth, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons’
wives with him: 
\v 19  Every beast, every creeping thing, and every fowl, \add and\add*
whatsoever creepeth upon the earth, after their kinds, went forth
out of the ark.\f +  \ft kinds: Heb. families\f* 
\p
\v 20 ¶ And Noah builded an altar unto the \nd LORD\nd*; and took
of every clean beast, and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt
offerings on the altar. 
\v 21  And the \nd LORD\nd* smelled  a sweet savour; and the \nd LORD\nd*
said in his heart, I will not again curse the ground any more for
man’s sake; for the imagination of man’s heart \add is\add* evil
from his youth; neither will I again smite any more every thing living,
as I have done.\f +  \ft a sweet…: Heb. a savour of rest or, satisfaction\f*\f + 
\ft for the imagination: or, through the imagination\f* 
\v 22  While the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and cold
and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease.\f + 
\ft While…: Heb. As yet all the days of the earth\f* 
\c 9  
\p
\v 1  And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said unto them, Be fruitful,
and multiply, and replenish the earth. 
\v 2  And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every
beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that
moveth \add upon\add* the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea;
into your hand are they delivered. 
\v 3  Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you; even as the
green herb have I given you all things. 
\v 4  But flesh with the life thereof, \add which is\add* the blood
thereof, shall ye not eat. 
\v 5  And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the
hand of every beast will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the
hand of every man’s brother will I require the life of man. 
\v 6  Whoso sheddeth man’s blood, by man shall his blood be shed:
for in the image of God made he man. 
\v 7  And you, be ye fruitful, and multiply; bring forth abundantly
in the earth, and multiply therein. 
\p
\v 8 ¶ And God spake unto Noah, and to his sons with him, saying,
\v 9  And I, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your
seed after you; 
\v 10  And with every living creature that \add is\add* with you, of the
fowl, of the cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you; from all that go
out of the ark, to every beast of the earth. 
\v 11  And I will establish my covenant with you; neither shall all
flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall there any more be a
flood to destroy the earth. 
\p
\v 12  And God said, This \add is\add* the token of the covenant
which I make between me and you and every living creature that \add is\add*
with you, for perpetual generations: 
\v 13  I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token
of a covenant between me and the earth. 
\v 14  And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the earth,
that the bow shall be seen in the cloud: 
\v 15  And I will remember my covenant, which \add is\add* between me and you and every
living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a
flood to destroy all flesh. 
\v 16  And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it,
that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every
living creature of all flesh that \add is\add* upon the earth. 
\v 17  And God said unto Noah, This \add is\add* the token of the
covenant, which I have established between me and all flesh that
\add is\add* upon the earth. 
\p
\v 18 ¶ And the sons of Noah, that went forth of the ark, were Shem,
and Ham, and Japheth: and Ham \add is\add* the father of Canaan.\f + 
\ft Canaan: Heb. Chenaan\f* 
\v 19 These \add are\add* the three sons of Noah: and of them was the whole
earth overspread. 
\v 20  And Noah began \add to be\add* an husbandman, and he planted
a vineyard: 
\v 21  And he drank of the wine, and was drunken; and he was uncovered
within his tent. 
\v 22  And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father,
and told his two brethren without. 
\v 23  And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid \add it\add*
upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness
of their father; and their faces \add were\add* backward, and they
saw not their father’s nakedness. 
\p
\v 24  And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his younger son
had done unto him. 
\v 25  And he said, Cursed \add be\add* Canaan; a servant of servants
shall he be unto his brethren. 
\v 26  And he said, Blessed \add be\add* the \nd LORD\nd* God of
Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant.\f +  \ft his servant: or, servant to

\v 27  God shall enlarge Japheth, and he shall dwell in the tents
of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant.\f +  \ft enlarge: or, persuade\f*
\p
\v 28 ¶ And Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years.
\v 29  And all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years:
and he died. 
\c 10  
\p
\v 1 Now these \add are\add* the generations of the sons of Noah,
Shem, Ham, and Japheth: and unto them were sons born after the flood.
\v 2  The sons of Japheth; Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan,
and Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras. 
\v 3  And the sons of Gomer; Ashkenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah.
\v 4  And the sons of Javan; Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim.\f + 
\ft Dodanim: or, as some read it, Rodanim\f* 
\v 5  By these were the isles of the Gentiles divided in their lands;
every one after his tongue, after their families, in their nations.

\v 6 ¶ And the sons of Ham; Cush, and Mizraim, and Phut, and Canaan.
\v 7  And the sons of Cush; Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and Raamah,
and Sabtecha: and the sons of Raamah; Sheba, and Dedan. 
\v 8  And Cush begat Nimrod: he began to be a mighty one in the earth.
\v 9  He was a mighty hunter before the \nd LORD\nd*: wherefore it is
said, Even as Nimrod the mighty hunter before the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\v 10  And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and
Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.\f +  \ft Babel: Gr. Babylon\f*
\v 11  Out of that land went forth Asshur, and builded Nineveh, and the

and Caphtorim.

\v 18  And the Arvadite, and the Zemarite, and the Hamathite: and
afterward were the families of the Canaanites spread abroad. 
\v 19  And the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon, as thou comest

\v 20 These \add are\add* the sons of Ham, after their families,

\v 25  And unto Eber were born two sons: the name of one \add was\add*
Peleg; for in his days was the earth divided; and his brother’s name
\add was\add* Joktan.\f +  \ft Peleg: that is Division\f* 
\v 26  And Joktan begat Almodad, and Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth, and

\v 27  And Hadoram, and Uzal, and Diklah, 
\v 28  And Obal, and Abimael, and Sheba, 
\v 29  And Ophir, and Havilah, and Jobab: all these \add were\add*
the sons of Joktan. 
\v 30  And their dwelling was from Mesha, as thou goest unto Sephar
a mount of the east. 
\v 31 These \add are\add* the sons of Shem, after their families,
after their tongues, in their lands, after their nations. 
\v 32 These \add are\add* the families of the sons of Noah, after their
generations, in their nations: and by these were the nations divided
in the earth after the flood. 
\c 11  
\p
\v 1  And the whole earth was of one language, and of one speech.\f + 
\ft language: Heb. lip.\f*\f +  \ft speech: Heb. words\f* 
\v 2  And it came to pass, as they journeyed from the east, that they
found a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt there.\f +  \ft from…: or,

\v 3  And they said one to another, Go to, let us make brick, and

abroad upon the face of the whole earth. 
\p
\v 5  And the \nd LORD\nd* came down to see the city and the tower,
which the children of men builded. 
\v 6  And the \nd LORD\nd* said, Behold, the people \add is\add*
one, and they have all one language; and this they begin to do: and now
nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to
do. 
\v 7  Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that
they may not understand one another’s speech. 
\v 8  So the \nd LORD\nd* scattered them abroad from thence upon the
face of all the earth: and they left off to build the city. 
\v 9  Therefore is the name of it called Babel; because the \nd LORD\nd*
did there confound the language of all the earth: and from thence
did the \nd LORD\nd* scatter them abroad upon the face of all the
earth.\f +  \ft Babel: that is, Confusion\f* 
\p
\v 10 ¶ These \add are\add* the generations of Shem: Shem \add was\add*

\v 24  And Nahor lived nine and twenty years, and begat Terah:\f +

\v 25  And Nahor lived after he begat Terah an hundred and nineteen

\v 26  And Terah lived seventy years, and begat Abram, Nahor, and
Haran. 
\p
\v 27 ¶ Now these \add are\add* the generations of Terah: Terah begat
Abram, Nahor, and Haran; and Haran begat Lot. 
\v 28  And Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his
nativity, in Ur of the Chaldees. 
\v 29  And Abram and Nahor took them wives: the name of Abram’s wife
\add was\add* Sarai; and the name of Nahor’s wife, Milcah, the daughter
of Haran, the father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah. 
\v 30  But Sarai was barren; she \add had\add* no child. 
\v 31  And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his
son’s son, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Abram’s wife; and they went
forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan;
and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there. 
\v 32  And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years: and
Terah died in Haran. 
\c 12  
\p
\v 1  Now the \nd LORD\nd* had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy
country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father’s house, unto a
land that I will shew thee: 
\v 2  And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and
make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing: 
\v 3  And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth
thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed. 
\p
\v 4  So Abram departed, as the \nd LORD\nd* had spoken unto him; and
Lot went with him: and Abram \add was\add* seventy and five years
old when he departed out of Haran. 
\v 5  And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother’s son, and all their
substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten
in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and into the
land of Canaan they came.

\v 7  And the \nd LORD\nd* appeared  unto Abram, and said, Unto thy

\v 8  And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Beth-el,
and pitched his tent, \add having\add* Beth-el on the west, and Hai
on the east: and there he builded an altar unto the \nd LORD\nd*,
and called upon the name of the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\v 9  And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the south.\f +

\p
\v 10 ¶ And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into
Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine \add was\add* grievous in the
land. 
\v 11  And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt,
that he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou \add art\add*
a fair woman to look upon: 
\v 12  Therefore it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall
see thee, that they shall say, This \add is\add* his wife: and they will
kill me, but they will save thee alive. 
\v 13  Say, I pray thee, thou \add art\add* my sister: that it may be
well with me for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee.
\p
\v 14 ¶ And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt,
the Egyptians beheld the woman that she \add was\add* very fair.
\v 15  The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before
Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh’s house. 
\v 16  And he entreated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep,
and oxen, and he asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and she
asses, and camels. 
\v 17  And the \nd LORD\nd* plagued  Pharaoh and his house with great
plagues because of Sarai Abram’s wife. 
\v 18  And Pharaoh called Abram, and said, What \add is\add* this
\add that\add* thou hast done unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she
\add was\add* thy wife? 
\v 19  Why saidst thou, She \add is\add* my sister? so I might have
taken her to me to wife: now therefore behold thy wife, take \add her\add*,
and go thy way. 
\v 20  And Pharaoh commanded \add his\add* men concerning him: and they sent him
away, and his wife, and all that he had. 
\c 13  
\p
\v 1  And Abram went up out of Egypt, he, and his wife, and all that he had, and
Lot with him, into the south. 
\v 2  And Abram \add was\add* very rich in cattle, in silver, and in
gold. 
\v 3  And he went on his journeys from the south even to Beth-el,
unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between
Beth-el and Hai; 
\v 4  Unto the place of the altar, which he had made there at the
first: and there Abram called on the name of the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\p
\v 5 ¶ And Lot also, which went with Abram, had flocks, and herds,
and tents. 
\v 6  And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell
together: for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell
together. 
\v 7  And there was a strife between the herdmen of Abram’s cattle
and the herdmen of Lot’s cattle: and the Canaanite and the Perizzite
dwelled then in the land. 
\v 8  And Abram said unto Lot, Let there be no strife, I pray thee, between me and thee, and between my
herdmen and thy herdmen; for we \add be\add* brethren.\f +  \ft brethren: Heb. men
brethren\f* 
\v 9  \add Is\add* not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray thee, from me: if
\add thou wilt take\add* the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if
\add thou depart\add* to the right hand, then I will go to the left.
\p
\v 10  And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the plain of Jordan, that it
\add was\add* well watered every where, before the \nd LORD\nd* destroyed
Sodom and Gomorrah, \add even\add* as the garden of the \nd LORD\nd*,
like the land of Egypt, as thou comest unto Zoar. 
\v 11  Then Lot chose him all the plain of Jordan; and Lot journeyed
east: and they separated themselves the one from the other. 
\v 12  Abram dwelled in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelled in the
cities of the plain, and pitched \add his\add* tent toward Sodom.
\v 13  But the men of Sodom \add were\add* wicked and sinners before the
\nd LORD\nd* exceedingly. 
\p
\v 14 ¶ And the \nd LORD\nd* said unto Abram, after that Lot was
separated from him, Lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place
where thou art northward, and southward, and eastward, and westward:
\v 15  For all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it,
and to thy seed for ever. 
\v 16  And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so that
if a man can number the dust of the earth, \add then\add* shall thy
seed also be numbered. 
\v 17  Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the
breadth of it; for I will give it unto thee. 
\v 18  Then Abram removed \add his\add* tent, and came and dwelt
in the plain of Mamre, which \add is\add* in Hebron, and built there an
altar unto the \nd LORD\nd*.\f +  \ft plain: Heb. plains\f* 
\c 14  
\p
\v 1  And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar,
Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king
of nations; 
\v 2  \add That these\add* made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with
Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king
of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela, which is Zoar. 
\v 3  All these were joined together in the vale of Siddim, which
is the salt sea. 
\v 4  Twelve years they served Chedorlaomer, and in the thirteenth
year they rebelled. 
\v 5  And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings that
\add were\add* with him, and smote the Rephaims in Ashteroth Karnaim,
and the Zuzims in Ham, and the Emims in Shaveh Kiriathaim,\f +  \ft Shaveh…: or, The plain of
Kiriathaim\f* 
\v 6  And the Horites in their mount Seir, unto El-paran, which \add is\add*
by the wilderness.\f +  \ft El-paran: or, The plain of Paran\f* 
\v 7  And they returned, and came to En-mishpat, which \add is\add*
Kadesh, and smote all the country of the Amalekites, and also the
Amorites, that dwelt in Hazezon-tamar. 
\v 8  And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah,
and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela
(the same \add is\add* Zoar;) and they joined battle with them in the
vale of Siddim; 
\v 9  With Chedorlaomer the king of Elam, and with Tidal king of
nations, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar;
four kings with five. 
\v 10  And the vale of Siddim \add was full of\add* slimepits; and the
kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and fell there; and they that remained
fled to the mountain. 
\v 11  And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their
victuals, and went their way. 
\v 12  And they took Lot, Abram’s brother’s son, who dwelt in Sodom,
and his goods, and departed. 
\p
\v 13 ¶ And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew;
for he dwelt in the plain of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol,
and brother of Aner: and these \add were\add* confederate with Abram.\f + 
\ft plain: Heb. plains\f* 
\v 14  And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he
armed his trained \add servants\add*, born in his own house, three
hundred and eighteen, and pursued \add them\add* unto Dan.\f +  \ft armed: or, led
forth\f*\f +  \ft trained: or, instructed\f* 
\v 15  And he divided himself against them, he and his servants,
by night, and smote them, and pursued them unto Hobah, which \add is\add*
on the left hand of Damascus. 
\v 16  And he brought back all the goods, and also brought again
his brother Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the people.
\p
\v 17 ¶ And the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return
from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer, and of the kings that \add were\add*
with him, at the valley of Shaveh, which \add is\add* the king’s
dale. 
\v 18  And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he
\add was\add* the priest of the most high God. 
\v 19  And he blessed him, and said, Blessed \add be\add* Abram of the most
high God, possessor of heaven and earth: 
\v 20  And blessed be the most high God, which hath delivered thine
enemies into thy hand. And he gave him tithes of all. 
\p
\v 21  And the king of Sodom said unto Abram, Give me the persons,
and take the goods to thyself.\f +  \ft persons: Heb. souls\f* 
\v 22  And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lift up mine hand
unto the \nd LORD\nd*, the most high God, the possessor of heaven
and earth, 
\v 23  That I will not \add take\add* from a thread even to a shoelatchet,
and that I will not take any thing that \add is\add* thine, lest thou shouldest
say, I have made Abram rich: 
\v 24  Save only that which the young men have eaten, and the portion
of the men which went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; let them
take their portion. 
\c 15  
\p
\v 1  After these things the word of the \nd LORD\nd* came unto Abram
in a vision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I \add am\add* thy shield,
\add and\add* thy exceeding great reward. 
\p
\v 2  And Abram said, Lord \nd GOD\nd*, what wilt thou give me, seeing I
go childless, and the steward of my house \add is\add* this Eliezer
of Damascus? 
\v 3  And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and, lo, one
born in my house is mine heir. 
\v 4  And, behold, the word of the \nd LORD\nd* \add came\add* unto him,
saying, This shall not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth
out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir. 
\v 5  And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward
heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he
said unto him, So shall thy seed be. 
\v 6  And he believed in the \nd LORD\nd*; and he counted it to him for
righteousness. 
\p
\v 7  And he said unto him, I \add am\add* the \nd LORD\nd* that brought thee
out of Ur of the Chaldees, to give thee this land to inherit it.
\v 8  And he said, Lord \nd GOD\nd*, whereby shall I know that I shall inherit
it? 
\v 9  And he said unto him, Take me an heifer of three years old,
and a she goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old,
and a turtledove, and a young pigeon. 
\v 10  And he took unto him all these, and divided them in the midst,
and laid each piece one against another: but the birds divided he not.
\v 11  And when the fowls came down upon the carcases, Abram drove them
away. 
\p
\v 12  And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram;
and, lo, an horror of great darkness fell upon him. 
\v 13  And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a
stranger in a land \add that is\add* not theirs, and shall serve
them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years; 
\v 14  And also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge:
and afterward shall they come out with great substance. 
\v 15  And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried
in a good old age. 
\v 16  But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again:
for the iniquity of the Amorites \add is\add* not yet full. 
\p
\v 17  And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was
dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed between
those pieces.\f +  \ft a burning…: Heb. a lamp of fire\f* 
\v 18  In the same day the \nd LORD\nd* made a covenant with Abram,
saying, Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt
unto the great river, the river Euphrates: 
\v 19  The Kenites, and the Kenizzites, and the Kadmonites, 
\v 20  And the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Rephaims, 
\v 21  And the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Girgashites,
and the Jebusites. 
\c 16  
\p
\v 1  Now Sarai Abram’s wife bare him no children: and she had an
handmaid, an Egyptian, whose name \add was\add* Hagar. 
\v 2  And Sarai said unto Abram, Behold now, the \nd LORD\nd* hath restrained
me from bearing: I pray thee, go in unto my maid; it may be that I may obtain
children by her. And Abram hearkened to the voice of Sarai.\f + 
\ft obtain…: Heb. be built by her\f* 
\v 3  And Sarai Abram’s wife took Hagar her maid the Egyptian, after
Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan, and gave her to her
husband Abram to be his wife. 
\p
\v 4 ¶ And he went in unto Hagar, and she conceived: and when she
saw that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes.
\v 5  And Sarai said unto Abram, My wrong \add be\add* upon thee: I have
given my maid into thy bosom; and when she saw that she had conceived,
I was despised in her eyes: the \nd LORD\nd* judge between me and thee.
\v 6  But Abram said unto Sarai, Behold, thy maid \add is\add* in thy
hand; do to her as it pleaseth thee. And when Sarai dealt hardly
with her, she fled from her face.\f +  \ft as…: Heb. that which is good in thine
eyes\f*\f +  \ft dealt…: Heb. afflicted her\f* 
\p
\v 7 ¶ And the angel of the \nd LORD\nd* found her by a fountain
of water in the wilderness, by the fountain in the way to Shur. 
\v 8  And he said, Hagar, Sarai’s maid, whence camest thou? and whither wilt thou
go? And she said, I flee from the face of my mistress Sarai. 
\v 9  And the angel of the \nd LORD\nd* said unto her, Return to thy
mistress, and submit thyself under her hands. 
\p
\v 10  And the angel of the \nd LORD\nd* said unto her, I will multiply
thy seed exceedingly, that it shall not be numbered for multitude.
\v 11  And the angel of the \nd LORD\nd* said unto her, Behold, thou
\add art\add* with child, and shalt bear a son, and shalt call his
name Ishmael; because the \nd LORD\nd* hath heard thy affliction.\f + 
\ft Ishmael: that is, God shall hear\f* 
\v 12  And he will be a wild man; his hand \add will be\add* against every man, and every man’s
hand against him; and he shall dwell in the presence of all his brethren.
\v 13  And she called the name of the \nd LORD\nd* that spake unto her, Thou
God seest me: for she said, Have I also here looked after him that seeth
me? 
\v 14  Wherefore the well was called Beer-lahai-roi; behold, \add it
is\add* between Kadesh and Bered.\f +  \ft Beer-lahai-roi: that is, The well of him that liveth and seeth

\p
\v 15 ¶ And Hagar bare Abram a son: and Abram called his son’s name,
which Hagar bare, Ishmael. 
\v 16  And Abram \add was\add* fourscore and six years old, when
Hagar bare Ishmael to Abram. 
\c 17  
\p
\v 1  And when Abram was ninety years old and nine, the \nd LORD\nd*
appeared to Abram, and said unto him, I \add am\add* the Almighty
God; walk before me, and be thou perfect.\f +  \ft perfect: or, upright, or,
sincere\f* 
\v 2  And I will make my covenant between me and thee, and will multiply
thee exceedingly. 
\v 3  And Abram fell on his face: and God talked with him, saying,
\p
\v 4  As for me, behold, my covenant \add is\add* with thee, and thou shalt be a
father of many nations.\f +  \ft many…: Heb. multitude of nations\f*
\v 5  Neither shall thy name any more be called Abram, but thy name
shall be Abraham; for a father of many nations have I made thee.\f + 
\ft Abraham: that is, Father of a great multitude\f* 
\v 6  And I will make thee exceeding fruitful, and I will make nations
of thee, and kings shall come out of thee. 
\p
\v 7  And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy
seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant,
to be a God unto thee, and to thy seed after thee. 
\v 8  And I will give unto thee, and to thy seed after thee, the
land wherein thou art a stranger, all the land of Canaan, for an
everlasting possession; and I will be their God.\f +  \ft wherein…: Heb. of thy
sojournings\f* 
\p
\v 9 ¶ And God said unto Abraham, Thou shalt keep my covenant therefore, thou, and thy
seed after thee in their generations. 
\v 10 This \add is\add* my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you and thy
seed after thee; Every man child among you shall be circumcised.
\v 11  And ye shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin; and it shall be a
token of the covenant betwixt me and you. 
\v 12  And he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you, every man
child in your generations, he that is born in the house, or bought
with money of any stranger, which \add is\add* not of thy seed.\f + 
\ft he that is eight…: Heb. a son of eight days\f* 
\v 13  He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy
money, must needs be circumcised: and my covenant shall be in your
flesh for an everlasting covenant. 
\v 14  And the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin
is not circumcised, that soul shall be cut off from his people; he hath
broken my covenant. 
\p
\v 15 ¶ And God said unto Abraham, As for Sarai thy wife, thou shalt not
call her name Sarai, but Sarah \add shall\add* her name \add be\add*.\f + 
\ft Sarah: that is Princess\f* 
\v 16  And I will bless her, and give thee a son also of her: yea, I will
bless her, and she shall be \add a mother\add* of nations; kings
of people shall be of her.\f +  \ft she…: Heb. she shall become nations\f*
\v 17  Then Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said in his
heart, Shall \add a child\add* be born unto him that is an hundred
years old? and shall Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear? 
\v 18  And Abraham said unto God, O that Ishmael might live before
thee! 
\v 19  And God said, Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed;
and thou shalt call his name Isaac: and I will establish my covenant
with him for an everlasting covenant, \add and\add* with his seed
after him. 
\v 20  And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee: Behold, I have blessed
him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly;
twelve princes shall he beget, and I will make him a great nation.
\v 21  But my covenant will I establish with Isaac, which Sarah shall
bear unto thee at this set time in the next year. 
\v 22  And he left off talking with him, and God went up from Abraham.
\p
\v 23 ¶ And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all that were born
in his house, and all that were bought with his money, every male
among the men of Abraham’s house; and circumcised the flesh of their
foreskin in the selfsame day, as God had said unto him. 
\v 24  And Abraham \add was\add* ninety years old and nine, when he was
circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin. 
\v 25  And Ishmael his son \add was\add* thirteen years old, when he was
circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin. 
\v 26  In the selfsame day was Abraham circumcised, and Ishmael his
son. 
\v 27  And all the men of his house, born in the house, and bought
with money of the stranger, were circumcised with him. 
\c 18  
\p
\v 1  And the \nd LORD\nd* appeared  unto him in the plains of Mamre:
and he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day;\f +  \ft plain: Heb.
plains\f* 
\v 2  And he lift up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood
by him: and when he saw \add them\add*, he ran to meet them from the
tent door, and bowed himself toward the ground, 
\v 3  And said, My Lord, if now I have found favour in thy sight,
pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant: 
\v 4  Let a little water, I pray you, be fetched, and wash your feet,
and rest yourselves under the tree: 
\v 5  And I will fetch a morsel of bread, and comfort ye your hearts;
after that ye shall pass on: for therefore are ye come to your servant.
And they said, So do, as thou hast said.\f +  \ft comfort: Heb. stay\f*\f + 
\ft are…: Heb. you have passed\f* 
\v 6  And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said, Make ready
quickly three measures of fine meal, knead \add it\add*, and make
cakes upon the hearth.\f +  \ft Make ready…: Heb. Hasten\f* 
\v 7  And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetcht a calf tender and
good, and gave \add it\add* unto a young man; and he hasted to dress it.
\v 8  And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed,
and set \add it\add* before them; and he stood by them under the
tree, and they did eat. 
\p
\v 9 ¶ And they said unto him, Where \add is\add* Sarah thy wife?
And he said, Behold, in the tent. 
\v 10  And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the
time of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah
heard \add it\add* in the tent door, which \add was\add* behind him.
\v 11  Now Abraham and Sarah \add were\add* old \add and\add* well
stricken in age; \add and\add* it ceased to be with Sarah after the
manner of women. 
\v 12  Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed
old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also? 
\v 13  And the \nd LORD\nd* said unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah
laugh, saying, Shall I of a surety bear a child, which am old? 
\v 14  Is any thing too hard for the \nd LORD\nd*? At the time appointed
I will return unto thee, according to the time of life, and Sarah
shall have a son. 
\v 15  Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid.
And he said, Nay; but thou didst laugh. 
\p
\v 16 ¶ And the men rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom:
and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way. 
\v 17  And the \nd LORD\nd* said, Shall I hide from Abraham that thing
which I do; 
\v 18  Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty
nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?
\v 19  For I know him, that he will command his children and his
household after him, and they shall keep the way of the \nd LORD\nd*,
to do justice and judgment; that the \nd LORD\nd* may bring upon
Abraham that which he hath spoken of him. 
\v 20  And the \nd LORD\nd* said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah
is great, and because their sin is very grievous; 
\v 21  I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether
according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will
know. 
\v 22  And the men turned their faces from thence, and went toward
Sodom: but Abraham stood yet before the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\p
\v 23 ¶ And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou also destroy the
righteous with the wicked? 
\v 24  Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou also
destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that \add are\add*
therein? 
\v 25  That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the
righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the
wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all the earth
do right? 
\v 26  And the \nd LORD\nd* said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous
within the city, then I will spare all the place for their sakes.
\v 27  And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon
me to speak unto the Lord, which \add am but\add* dust and ashes:
\v 28  Peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous:
wilt thou destroy all the city for \add lack of\add* five? And he
said, If I find there forty and five, I will not destroy \add it\add*.
\v 29  And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there shall be
forty found there. And he said, I will not do \add it\add* for forty’s sake.
\v 30  And he said \add unto him\add*, Oh let not the Lord be angry,
and I will speak: Peradventure there shall thirty be found there. And he
said, I will not do \add it\add*, if I find thirty there. 
\v 31  And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the
Lord: Peradventure there shall be twenty found there. And he said,
I will not destroy \add it\add* for twenty’s sake. 
\v 32  And he said, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak
yet but this once: Peradventure ten shall be found there. And he
said, I will not destroy \add it\add* for ten’s sake. 
\v 33  And the \nd LORD\nd* went his way, as soon as he had left
communing with Abraham: and Abraham returned unto his place. 
\c 19  
\p
\v 1  And there came two angels to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the
gate of Sodom: and Lot seeing \add them\add* rose up to meet them; and he
bowed himself with his face toward the ground; 
\v 2  And he said, Behold now, my lords, turn in, I pray you, into your
servant’s house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet, and ye shall rise up
early, and go on your ways. And they said, Nay; but we will abide
in the street all night. 
\v 3  And he pressed upon them greatly; and they turned in unto him, and
entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did bake unleavened
bread, and they did eat. 
\p
\v 4 ¶ But before they lay down, the men of the city, \add even\add*
the men of Sodom, compassed the house round, both old and young,
all the people from every quarter: 
\v 5  And they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where \add are\add*
the men which came in to thee this night? bring them out unto us, that we may
know them. 
\v 6  And Lot went out at the door unto them, and shut the door after
him, 
\v 7  And said, I pray you, brethren, do not so wickedly. 
\v 8  Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man;
let me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as
\add is\add* good in your eyes: only unto these men do nothing; for therefore
came they under the shadow of my roof. 
\v 9  And they said, Stand back. And they said \add again\add*, This
one \add fellow\add* came in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge:
now will we deal worse with thee, than with them. And they pressed
sore upon the man, \add even\add* Lot, and came near to break the
door. 
\v 10  But the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the
house to them, and shut to the door. 
\v 11  And they smote the men that \add were\add* at the door of the
house with blindness, both small and great: so that they wearied
themselves to find the door. 
\p
\v 12 ¶ And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son in
law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatsoever thou hast in the
city, bring \add them\add* out of this place: 
\v 13  For we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxen
great before the face of the \nd LORD\nd*; and the \nd LORD\nd* hath
sent us to destroy it. 
\v 14  And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons in law, which married
his daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this place; for the \nd LORD\nd*
will destroy this city. But he seemed as one that mocked unto his sons in
law. 
\p
\v 15 ¶ And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot,
saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters, which are here;
lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city.\f +  \ft are here: Heb. are
found\f*\f +  \ft iniquity: or, punishment\f* 
\v 16  And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon the
hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters; the \nd LORD\nd*
being merciful unto him: and they brought him forth, and set him
without the city. 
\p
\v 17 ¶ And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad,
that he said, Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither
stay thou in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be
consumed. 
\v 18  And Lot said unto them, Oh, not so, my Lord: 
\v 19  Behold now, thy servant hath found grace in thy sight, and thou hast
magnified thy mercy, which thou hast shewed unto me in saving my
life; and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest some evil take me, and I
die: 
\v 20  Behold now, this city \add is\add* near to flee unto, and
it \add is\add* a little one: Oh, let me escape thither, (\add is\add*
it not a little one?) and my soul shall live. 
\v 21  And he said unto him, See, I have accepted thee concerning this
thing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for the which thou hast
spoken.\f +  \ft thee: Heb. thy face\f* 
\v 22  Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot do any thing till thou be

\p
\v 23 ¶ The sun was risen upon the earth when Lot entered into Zoar.\f +

\p
\v 24  Then the \nd LORD\nd* rained  upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah
brimstone and fire from the \nd LORD\nd* out of heaven; 
\v 25  And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the
inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground. 
\p
\v 26 ¶ But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a
pillar of salt. 
\p
\v 27 ¶ And Abraham gat up early in the morning to the place where he
stood before the \nd LORD\nd*: 
\v 28  And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the
land of the plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the country
went up as the smoke of a furnace. 
\p
\v 29 ¶ And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the
plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst
of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in the which Lot dwelt.
\p
\v 30 ¶ And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and his
two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar: and he dwelt
in a cave, he and his two daughters. 
\v 31  And the firstborn said unto the younger, Our father \add is\add*
old, and \add there is\add* not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the
manner of all the earth: 
\v 32  Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may
preserve seed of our father. 
\v 33  And they made their father drink wine that night: and the
firstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived not when she lay
down, nor when she arose. 
\v 34  And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said
unto the younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father: let us make him
drink wine this night also; and go thou in, \add and\add* lie with him, that we may
preserve seed of our father. 
\v 35  And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the
younger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay
down, nor when she arose. 
\v 36  Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their father.
\v 37  And the firstborn bare a son, and called his name Moab: the
same \add is\add* the father of the Moabites unto this day. 
\v 38  And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his name
Ben-ammi: the same \add is\add* the father of the children of Ammon
unto this day. 
\c 20  
\p
\v 1  And Abraham journeyed from thence toward the south country,
and dwelled between Kadesh and Shur, and sojourned in Gerar. 
\v 2  And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, She \add is\add* my sister:
and Abimelech king of Gerar sent, and took Sarah. 
\p
\v 3  But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said to him, Behold, thou
\add art but\add* a dead man, for the woman which thou hast taken; for she
\add is\add* a man’s wife.\f +  \ft a man’s…: Heb. married to an
husband\f* 
\v 4  But Abimelech had not come near her: and he said, Lord, wilt thou
slay also a righteous nation? 
\v 5  Said he not unto me, She \add is\add* my sister? and she, even
she herself said, He \add is\add* my brother: in the integrity of my
heart and innocency of my hands have I done this.\f +  \ft integrity: or, simplicity, or,
sincerity\f* 
\v 6  And God said unto him in a dream, Yea, I know that thou didst
this in the integrity of thy heart; for I also withheld thee from
sinning against me: therefore suffered I thee not to touch her. 
\v 7  Now therefore restore the man \add his\add* wife; for he \add is\add*
a prophet, and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live: and if thou
restore \add her\add* not, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou, and all that
\add are\add* thine. 
\p
\v 8  Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his
servants, and told all these things in their ears: and the men were
sore afraid. 
\v 9  Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him, What hast thou
done unto us? and what have I offended thee, that thou hast brought
on me and on my kingdom a great sin? thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be
done. 
\v 10  And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What sawest thou, that thou hast
done this thing? 
\v 11  And Abraham said, Because I thought, Surely the fear of God
\add is\add* not in this place; and they will slay me for my wife’s
sake. 
\v 12  And yet indeed \add she is\add* my sister; she \add is\add*
the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my
wife. 
\v 13  And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my
father’s house, that I said unto her, This \add is\add* thy kindness
which thou shalt shew unto me; at every place whither we shall come,
say of me, He \add is\add* my brother. 
\p
\v 14  And Abimelech took sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and womenservants,
and gave \add them\add* unto Abraham, and restored him Sarah his
wife. 
\v 15  And Abimelech said, Behold, my land \add is\add* before thee:
dwell where it pleaseth thee.\f +  \ft where…: Heb. as is good in thine
eyes\f* 
\v 16  And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a
thousand \add pieces\add* of silver: behold, he \add is\add* to thee a
covering of the eyes, unto all that \add are\add* with thee, and with all
\add other:\add* thus she was reproved. 
\p
\v 17 ¶ So Abraham prayed unto God: and God healed Abimelech, and his
wife, and his maidservants; and they bare \add children\add*. 
\v 18  For the \nd LORD\nd* had fast closed up all the wombs of the
house of Abimelech, because of Sarah Abraham’s wife. 
\c 21  
\p
\v 1  And the \nd LORD\nd* visited Sarah as he had said, and the
\nd LORD\nd* did unto Sarah as he had spoken. 
\v 2  For Sarah conceived, and bare Abraham a son in his old age,
at the set time of which God had spoken to him. 
\v 3  And Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him, whom
Sarah bare to him, Isaac. 
\v 4  And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac being eight days old,
as God had commanded him. 
\v 5  And Abraham was an hundred years old, when his son Isaac was
born unto him. 
\p
\v 6 ¶ And Sarah said, God hath made me to laugh, \add so that\add*
all that hear will laugh with me. 
\v 7  And she said, Who would have said unto Abraham, that Sarah
should have given children suck? for I have born \add him\add* a
son in his old age. 
\v 8  And the child grew, and was weaned: and Abraham made a great
feast the \add same\add* day that Isaac was weaned. 
\p
\v 9 ¶ And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, which she had
born unto Abraham, mocking. 
\v 10  Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this bondwoman and her
son: for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son,
\add even\add* with Isaac. 
\v 11  And the thing was very grievous in Abraham’s sight because
of his son. 
\p
\v 12 ¶ And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy
sight because of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in all that
Sarah hath said unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in Isaac shall thy
seed be called. 
\v 13  And also of the son of the bondwoman will I make a nation, because he
\add is\add* thy seed. 
\p
\v 14  And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread,
and a bottle of water, and gave \add it\add* unto Hagar, putting
\add it\add* on her shoulder, and the child, and sent her away: and she
departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beer-sheba. 
\v 15  And the water was spent in the bottle, and she cast the child
under one of the shrubs. 
\v 16  And she went, and sat her down over against \add him\add*
a good way off, as it were a bowshot: for she said, Let me not see
the death of the child. And she sat over against \add him\add*, and lift
up her voice, and wept. 
\v 17  And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God called
to Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar?
fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he \add is\add*.
\v 18  Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thine hand; for I will
make him a great nation. 
\v 19  And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she
went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink. 
\v 20  And God was with the lad; and he grew, and dwelt in the wilderness,
and became an archer. 
\v 21  And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran: and his mother took
him a wife out of the land of Egypt. 
\p
\v 22 ¶ And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phichol
the chief captain of his host spake unto Abraham, saying, God \add is\add*
with thee in all that thou doest: 
\v 23  Now therefore swear unto me here by God that thou wilt not deal
falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son’s son: \add but\add*
according to the kindness that I have done unto thee, thou shalt
do unto me, and to the land wherein thou hast sojourned.\f +  \ft that thou…: Heb. if thou shalt lie unto
me\f* 
\v 24  And Abraham said, I will swear. 
\v 25  And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of a well of water,
which Abimelech’s servants had violently taken away. 
\v 26  And Abimelech said, I wot not who hath done this thing: neither
didst thou tell me, neither yet heard I \add of it\add*, but to day.
\v 27  And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them unto Abimelech;
and both of them made a covenant. 
\v 28  And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.
\v 29  And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What \add mean\add* these
seven ewe lambs which thou hast set by themselves? 
\v 30  And he said, For \add these\add* seven ewe lambs shalt thou
take of my hand, that they may be a witness unto me, that I have
digged this well. 
\v 31  Wherefore he called that place Beer-sheba; because there they
sware both of them.\f +  \ft Beer-sheba: that is, The well of the
oath\f* 
\v 32  Thus they made a covenant at Beer-sheba: then Abimelech rose
up, and Phichol the chief captain of his host, and they returned
into the land of the Philistines. 
\p
\v 33 ¶ And \add Abraham\add* planted a grove in Beer-sheba, and
called there on the name of the \nd LORD\nd*, the everlasting God.\f + 
\ft grove: or, tree\f* 
\v 34  And Abraham sojourned in the Philistines’ land many days.
\c 22  
\p
\v 1  And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt
Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham: and he said, Behold, \add here\add* I
\add am\add*.\f +  \ft Behold…: Heb. Behold me\f* 
\v 2  And he said, Take now thy son, thine only \add son\add* Isaac,
whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer
him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will
tell thee of. 
\p
\v 3 ¶ And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled his
ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and
clave the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went unto the
place of which God had told him. 
\v 4  Then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the
place afar off. 
\v 5  And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the
ass; and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again to you.
\v 6  And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid \add it\add*
upon Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife;
and they went both of them together. 
\v 7  And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, My father:
and he said, Here \add am\add* I, my son. And he said, Behold the
fire and the wood: but where \add is\add* the lamb for a burnt offering?\f + 
\ft lamb: or, kid\f* 
\v 8  And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt
offering: so they went both of them together. 
\v 9  And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham
built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac
his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood. 
\v 10  And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to
slay his son. 
\p
\v 11  And the angel of the \nd LORD\nd* called unto him out of heaven,
and said, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here \add am\add* I. 
\v 12  And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou
any thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast
not withheld thy son, thine only \add son\add* from me. 
\v 13  And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind
\add him\add* a ram caught in a thicket by his horns: and Abraham
went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering in the
stead of his son. 
\v 14  And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah-jireh: as
it is said \add to\add* this day, In the mount of the \nd LORD\nd*
it shall be seen.\f +  \ft Jehovah-jireh: that is, The Lord will see, or,
provide\f* 
\p
\v 15 ¶ And the angel of the \nd LORD\nd* called unto Abraham out of
heaven the second time, 
\v 16  And said, By myself have I sworn, saith the \nd LORD\nd*,
for because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy
son, thine only \add son:\add* 
\v 17  That in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will
multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which
\add is\add* upon the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess the gate
of his enemies;\f +  \ft shore: Heb. lip\f* 
\v 18  And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed;
because thou hast obeyed my voice. 
\v 19  So Abraham returned unto his young men, and they rose up and
went together to Beer-sheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beer-sheba. 
\p
\v 20 ¶ And it came to pass after these things, that it was told
Abraham, saying, Behold, Milcah, she hath also born children unto thy
brother Nahor; 
\v 21  Huz his firstborn, and Buz his brother, and Kemuel the father
of Aram, 
\v 22  And Chesed, and Hazo, and Pildash, and Jidlaph, and Bethuel.
\v 23  And Bethuel begat Rebekah: these eight Milcah did bear to
Nahor, Abraham’s brother.\f +  \ft Rebekah: Gr. Rebecca\f* 
\v 24  And his concubine, whose name \add was\add* Reumah, she bare
also Tebah, and Gaham, and Thahash, and Maachah. 
\c 23  
\p
\v 1  And Sarah was an hundred and seven and twenty years old: \add these
were\add* the years of the life of Sarah. 
\v 2  And Sarah died in Kirjath-arba; the same \add is\add* Hebron
in the land of Canaan: and Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to
weep for her. 
\p
\v 3 ¶ And Abraham stood up from before his dead, and spake unto the
sons of Heth, saying, 
\v 4 I \add am\add* a stranger and a sojourner with you: give me a
possession of a buryingplace with you, that I may bury my dead out of my
sight. 
\v 5  And the children of Heth answered Abraham, saying unto him,
\v 6  Hear us, my lord: thou \add art\add* a mighty prince among
us: in the choice of our sepulchres bury thy dead; none of us shall
withhold from thee his sepulchre, but that thou mayest bury thy dead.\f + 
\ft a mighty…: Heb. a prince of God\f* 
\v 7  And Abraham stood up, and bowed himself to the people of the
land, \add even\add* to the children of Heth. 
\v 8  And he communed with them, saying, If it be your mind that I should
bury my dead out of my sight; hear me, and intreat for me to Ephron
the son of Zohar, 
\v 9  That he may give me the cave of Machpelah, which he hath, which
\add is\add* in the end of his field; for as much money as it is
worth he shall give it me for a possession of a buryingplace amongst
you.\f +  \ft as much…: Heb. full money\f* 
\v 10  And Ephron dwelt among the children of Heth: and Ephron the
Hittite answered  Abraham in the audience of the children of Heth,
\add even\add* of all that went in at the gate of his city, saying,\f + 
\ft audience: Heb. ears\f* 
\v 11  Nay, my lord, hear me: the field give I thee, and the cave that
\add is\add* therein, I give it thee; in the presence of the sons
of my people give I it thee: bury thy dead. 
\v 12  And Abraham bowed down himself before the people of the land.
\v 13  And he spake unto Ephron in the audience of the people of the
land, saying, But if thou \add wilt give it\add*, I pray thee, hear
me: I will give thee money for the field; take \add it\add* of me, and I will
bury my dead there. 
\v 14  And Ephron answered Abraham, saying unto him, 
\v 15  My lord, hearken unto me: the land \add is worth\add* four
hundred shekels of silver; what \add is\add* that betwixt me and thee?
bury therefore thy dead. 
\p
\v 16  And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron; and Abraham weighed to
Ephron the silver, which he had named in the audience of the sons
of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current \add money\add*
with the merchant. 
\p
\v 17 ¶ And the field of Ephron, which \add was\add* in Machpelah, which
\add was\add* before Mamre, the field, and the cave which \add was\add*
therein, and all the trees that \add were\add* in the field, that
\add were\add* in all the borders round about, were made sure 
\v 18  Unto Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children
of Heth, before all that went in at the gate of his city. 
\v 19  And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave
of the field of Machpelah before Mamre: the same \add is\add* Hebron
in the land of Canaan. 
\v 20  And the field, and the cave that \add is\add* therein, were made
sure unto Abraham for a possession of a buryingplace by the sons
of Heth. 
\c 24  
\p
\v 1  And Abraham was old, \add and\add* well stricken in age: and the
\nd LORD\nd* had blessed Abraham in all things.\f +  \ft well…: Heb. gone into
days\f* 
\v 2  And Abraham said unto his eldest servant of his house, that ruled
over all that he had, Put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh:
\v 3  And I will make thee swear by the \nd LORD\nd*, the God of
heaven, and the God of the earth, that thou shalt not take a wife
unto my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell:
\v 4  But thou shalt go unto my country, and to my kindred, and take
a wife unto my son Isaac. 
\v 5  And the servant said unto him, Peradventure the woman will not be
willing to follow me unto this land: must I needs bring thy son again
unto the land from whence thou camest? 
\v 6  And Abraham said unto him, Beware thou that thou bring not
my son thither again. 
\p
\v 7 ¶ The \nd LORD\nd* God of heaven, which took me from my father’s
house, and from the land of my kindred, and which spake unto me, and that
sware unto me, saying, Unto thy seed will I give this land; he shall
send his angel before thee, and thou shalt take a wife unto my son from thence.
\v 8  And if the woman will not be willing to follow thee, then thou shalt be
clear from this my oath: only bring not my son thither again. 
\v 9  And the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his
master, and sware to him concerning that matter. 
\p
\v 10 ¶ And the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master,
and departed; for all the goods of his master \add were\add* in his
hand: and he arose, and went to Mesopotamia, unto the city of Nahor.\f + 
\ft for: or, and\f* 
\v 11  And he made his camels to kneel down without the city by a
well of water at the time of the evening, \add even\add* the time
that women go out to draw \add water\add*.\f +  \ft that…: Heb. that women who draw water go
forth\f* 
\v 12  And he said, O \nd LORD\nd* God of my master Abraham, I pray thee, send
me good speed this day, and shew kindness unto my master Abraham.
\v 13  Behold, I stand \add here\add* by the well of water; and the
daughters of the men of the city come out to draw water: 
\v 14  And let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say,
Let down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink; and she shall
say, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: \add let the same
be\add* she \add that\add* thou hast appointed for thy servant Isaac;
and thereby shall I know that thou hast shewed kindness unto my master.
\p
\v 15 ¶ And it came to pass, before he had done speaking, that, behold,
Rebekah came out, who was born to Bethuel, son of Milcah, the wife
of Nahor, Abraham’s brother, with her pitcher upon her shoulder.
\v 16  And the damsel \add was\add* very fair to look upon, a virgin,
neither had any man known her: and she went down to the well, and
filled her pitcher, and came up.\f +  \ft very…: Heb. good of countenance\f*
\v 17  And the servant ran to meet her, and said, Let me, I pray thee,
drink a little water of thy pitcher. 
\v 18  And she said, Drink, my lord: and she hasted, and let down
her pitcher upon her hand, and gave him drink. 
\v 19  And when she had done giving him drink, she said, I will draw
\add water\add* for thy camels also, until they have done drinking.
\v 20  And she hasted, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and
ran again unto the well to draw \add water\add*, and drew for all his
camels. 
\v 21  And the man wondering at her held his peace, to wit whether the
\nd LORD\nd* had made his journey prosperous or not. 
\v 22  And it came to pass, as the camels had done drinking, that the
man took a golden earring of half a shekel weight, and two bracelets
for her hands of ten \add shekels\add* weight of gold;\f +  \ft earring: or, jewel for the
forehead\f* 
\v 23  And said, Whose daughter \add art\add* thou? tell me, I pray thee: is
there room \add in\add* thy father’s house for us to lodge in? 
\v 24  And she said unto him, I \add am\add* the daughter of Bethuel
the son of Milcah, which she bare unto Nahor. 
\v 25  She said moreover unto him, We have both straw and provender
enough, and room to lodge in. 
\v 26  And the man bowed down his head, and worshipped the \nd LORD\nd*.
\v 27  And he said, Blessed \add be\add* the \nd LORD\nd* God of my
master Abraham, who hath not left destitute my master of his mercy
and his truth: I \add being\add* in the way, the \nd LORD\nd* led
me to the house of my master’s brethren. 
\v 28  And the damsel ran, and told \add them of\add* her mother’s
house these things. 
\p
\v 29 ¶ And Rebekah had a brother, and his name \add was\add* Laban:
and Laban ran out unto the man, unto the well. 
\v 30  And it came to pass, when he saw the earring and bracelets
upon his sister’s hands, and when he heard the words of Rebekah his
sister, saying, Thus spake the man unto me; that he came unto the
man; and, behold, he stood by the camels at the well. 
\v 31  And he said, Come in, thou blessed of the \nd LORD\nd*; wherefore
standest thou without? for I have prepared the house, and room for the
camels. 
\p
\v 32 ¶ And the man came into the house: and he ungirded his camels,
and gave straw and provender for the camels, and water to wash his
feet, and the men’s feet that \add were\add* with him. 
\v 33  And there was set \add meat\add* before him to eat: but he
said, I will not eat, until I have told mine errand. And he said,
Speak on. 
\v 34  And he said, I \add am\add* Abraham’s servant. 
\v 35  And the \nd LORD\nd* hath blessed my master greatly; and he is become
great: and he hath given him flocks, and herds, and silver, and gold,
and menservants, and maidservants, and camels, and asses. 
\v 36  And Sarah my master’s wife bare a son to my master when she was
old: and unto him hath he given all that he hath. 
\v 37  And my master made me swear, saying, Thou shalt not take a
wife to my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land
I dwell: 
\v 38  But thou shalt go unto my father’s house, and to my kindred,
and take a wife unto my son. 
\v 39  And I said unto my master, Peradventure the woman will not
follow me. 
\v 40  And he said unto me, The \nd LORD\nd*, before whom I walk,
will send his angel with thee, and prosper thy way; and thou shalt
take a wife for my son of my kindred, and of my father’s house: 
\v 41  Then shalt thou be clear from \add this\add* my oath, when thou
comest to my kindred; and if they give not thee \add one\add*, thou shalt be
clear from my oath. 
\v 42  And I came this day unto the well, and said, O \nd LORD\nd*
God of my master Abraham, if now thou do prosper my way which I go:
\v 43  Behold, I stand by the well of water; and it shall come to pass, that when the
virgin cometh forth to draw \add water\add*, and I say to her, Give
me, I pray thee, a little water of thy pitcher to drink; 
\v 44  And she say to me, Both drink thou, and I will also draw for thy
camels: \add let\add* the same \add be\add* the woman whom the \nd LORD\nd*
hath appointed out for my master’s son. 
\v 45  And before I had done speaking in mine heart, behold, Rebekah
came forth with her pitcher on her shoulder; and she went down unto the
well, and drew \add water:\add* and I said unto her, Let me drink, I pray thee.
\v 46  And she made haste, and let down her pitcher from her \add shoulder\add*,
and said, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: so I drank,
and she made the camels drink also. 
\v 47  And I asked her, and said, Whose daughter \add art\add* thou? And she
said, The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor’s son, whom Milcah bare unto him: and I
put the earring upon her face, and the bracelets upon her hands.
\v 48  And I bowed down my head, and worshipped the \nd LORD\nd*,
and blessed the \nd LORD\nd* God of my master Abraham, which had led
me in the right way to take my master’s brother’s daughter unto his
son. 
\v 49  And now if ye will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell
me: and if not, tell me; that I may turn to the right hand, or to the
left. 
\v 50  Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, The thing proceedeth
from the \nd LORD\nd*: we cannot speak unto thee bad or good. 
\v 51  Behold, Rebekah \add is\add* before thee, take \add her\add*,
and go, and let her be thy master’s son’s wife, as the \nd LORD\nd*
hath spoken. 
\v 52  And it came to pass, that, when Abraham’s servant heard their
words, he worshipped the \nd LORD\nd*, \add bowing himself\add* to the
earth. 
\v 53  And the servant brought forth jewels of silver, and jewels
of gold, and raiment, and gave \add them\add* to Rebekah: he gave
also to her brother and to her mother precious things.\f +  \ft jewels: Heb.
vessels\f* 
\p
\v 54  And they did eat and drink, he and the men that \add were\add*
with him, and tarried all night; and they rose up in the morning,
and he said, Send me away unto my master. 
\v 55  And her brother and her mother said, Let the damsel abide with us
\add a few\add* days, at the least ten; after that she shall go.\f + 
\ft a few…: or, a full year, or ten months\f* 
\v 56  And he said unto them, Hinder me not, seeing the \nd LORD\nd*
hath prospered my way; send me away that I may go to my master. 
\v 57  And they said, We will call the damsel, and enquire at her
mouth. 
\v 58  And they called Rebekah, and said unto her, Wilt thou go with this
man? And she said, I will go. 
\v 59  And they sent away Rebekah their sister, and her nurse, and
Abraham’s servant, and his men. 
\v 60  And they blessed Rebekah, and said unto her, Thou \add art\add*
our sister, be thou \add the mother\add* of thousands of millions,
and let thy seed possess the gate of those which hate them. 
\p
\v 61 ¶ And Rebekah arose, and her damsels, and they rode upon the
camels, and followed the man: and the servant took Rebekah, and went his
way. 
\p
\v 62  And Isaac came from the way of the well Lahai-roi; for he
dwelt in the south country. 
\v 63  And Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide:
and he lifted up his eyes, and saw, and, behold, the camels \add were\add*
coming.\f +  \ft to meditate: or, to pray\f* 
\v 64  And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she
lighted off the camel. 
\v 65 For she \add had\add* said unto the servant, What man \add is\add*
this that walketh in the field to meet us? And the servant \add had\add*
said, It \add is\add* my master: therefore she took a vail, and covered
herself. 
\v 66  And the servant told Isaac all things that he had done. 
\v 67  And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah’s tent, and took
Rebekah, and she became his wife; and he loved her: and Isaac was
comforted after his mother’s \add death\add*. 
\c 25  
\p
\v 1  Then again Abraham took a wife, and her name \add was\add*
Keturah. 
\v 2  And she bare him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian,
and Ishbak, and Shuah. 
\v 3  And Jokshan begat Sheba, and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were
Asshurim, and Letushim, and Leummim. 
\v 4  And the sons of Midian; Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and Abidah,
and Eldaah. All these \add were\add* the children of Keturah. 
\p
\v 5 ¶ And Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac. 
\v 6  But unto the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had, Abraham
gave gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived,
eastward, unto the east country. 
\v 7 And these \add are\add* the days of the years of Abraham’s life
which he lived, an hundred threescore and fifteen years. 
\v 8  Then Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age,
an old man, and full \add of years;\add* and was gathered to his
people. 
\v 9  And his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah,
in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which \add is\add*
before Mamre; 
\v 10  The field which Abraham purchased of the sons of Heth: there was
Abraham buried, and Sarah his wife. 
\p
\v 11 ¶ And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God
blessed his son Isaac; and Isaac dwelt by the well Lahai-roi. 
\p
\v 12 ¶ Now these \add are\add* the generations of Ishmael, Abraham’s
son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah’s handmaid, bare unto Abraham:
\v 13 And these \add are\add* the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their
names, according to their generations: the firstborn of Ishmael,
Nebajoth; and Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam, 
\v 14  And Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa, 
\v 15  Hadar, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah:\f +  \ft Hadar: or,
Hadad\f* 
\v 16 These \add are\add* the sons of Ishmael, and these \add are\add*
their names, by their towns, and by their castles; twelve princes
according to their nations. 
\v 17 And these \add are\add* the years of the life of Ishmael, an
hundred and thirty and seven years: and he gave up the ghost and
died; and was gathered unto his people. 
\v 18  And they dwelt from Havilah unto Shur, that \add is\add* before
Egypt, as thou goest toward Assyria: \add and\add* he died in the
presence of all his brethren.\f +  \ft died: Heb. fell\f* 
\p
\v 19 ¶ And these \add are\add* the generations of Isaac, Abraham’s
son: Abraham begat Isaac: 
\v 20  And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah to wife,
the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padan-aram, the sister to Laban
the Syrian. 
\v 21  And Isaac intreated the \nd LORD\nd* for his wife, because she
\add was\add* barren: and the \nd LORD\nd* was intreated of him, and
Rebekah his wife conceived. 
\v 22  And the children struggled together within her; and she said, If
\add it be\add* so, why \add am\add* I thus? And she went to enquire
of the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\v 23  And the \nd LORD\nd* said unto her, Two nations \add are\add*
in thy womb, and two manner of people shall be separated from thy
bowels; and \add the one\add* people shall be stronger than \add the
other\add* people; and the elder shall serve the younger. 
\p
\v 24 ¶ And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold,
\add there were\add* twins in her womb. 
\v 25  And the first came out red, all over like an hairy garment;
and they called his name Esau. 
\v 26  And after that came his brother out, and his hand took hold
on Esau’s heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac \add was\add*
threescore years old when she bare them. 
\v 27  And the boys grew: and Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of the
field; and Jacob \add was\add* a plain man, dwelling in tents. 
\v 28  And Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat of \add his\add*
venison: but Rebekah loved Jacob.\f +  \ft he…: Heb. venison was in his
mouth\f* 
\p
\v 29 ¶ And Jacob sod pottage: and Esau came from the field, and he
\add was\add* faint: 
\v 30  And Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, with that same
red \add pottage;\add* for I \add am\add* faint: therefore was his
name called Edom.\f +  \ft with…: Heb. with that red, with that red
pottage\f*\f +  \ft Edom: that is Red\f* 
\v 31  And Jacob said, Sell me this day thy birthright. 
\v 32  And Esau said, Behold, I \add am\add* at the point to die:
and what profit shall this birthright do to me?\f +  \ft at…: Heb. going to
die\f* 
\v 33  And Jacob said, Swear to me this day; and he sware unto him: and he
sold his birthright unto Jacob. 
\v 34  Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentiles; and he did
eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way: thus Esau despised
\add his\add* birthright. 
\c 26  
\p
\v 1  And there was a famine in the land, beside the first famine
that was in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went unto Abimelech king
of the Philistines unto Gerar. 
\v 2  And the \nd LORD\nd* appeared  unto him, and said, Go not down
into Egypt; dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of: 
\v 3  Sojourn in this land, and I will be with thee, and will bless
thee; for unto thee, and unto thy seed, I will give all these countries,
and I will perform the oath which I sware unto Abraham thy father;
\v 4  And I will make thy seed to multiply as the stars of heaven,
and will give unto thy seed all these countries; and in thy seed
shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; 
\v 5  Because that Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my
commandments, my statutes, and my laws. 
\p
\v 6 ¶ And Isaac dwelt in Gerar: 
\v 7  And the men of the place asked \add him\add* of his wife; and he
said, She \add is\add* my sister: for he feared to say, \add She
is\add* my wife; lest, \add said he\add*, the men of the place should
kill me for Rebekah; because she \add was\add* fair to look upon.
\v 8  And it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, that
Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and saw,
and, behold, Isaac \add was\add* sporting with Rebekah his wife.
\v 9  And Abimelech called Isaac, and said, Behold, of a surety she
\add is\add* thy wife: and how saidst thou, She \add is\add* my sister?
And Isaac said unto him, Because I said, Lest I die for her. 
\v 10  And Abimelech said, What \add is\add* this thou hast done
unto us? one of the people might lightly have lien with thy wife,
and thou shouldest have brought guiltiness upon us. 
\v 11  And Abimelech charged all \add his\add* people, saying, He that
toucheth this man or his wife shall surely be put to death. 
\p
\v 12  Then Isaac sowed in that land, and received in the same year
an hundredfold: and the \nd LORD\nd* blessed him.\f +  \ft received: Heb.
found\f* 
\v 13  And the man waxed great, and went forward, and grew until he
became very great: \f +  \ft went…: Heb. went going\f* 
\v 14  For he had possession of flocks, and possession of herds,
and great store of servants: and the Philistines envied him.\f + 
\ft servants: or, husbandry\f* 
\v 15  For all the wells which his father’s servants had digged in the
days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped them, and
filled them with earth. 
\v 16  And Abimelech said unto Isaac, Go from us; for thou art much
mightier  than we. 
\p
\v 17 ¶ And Isaac departed thence, and pitched his tent in the valley
of Gerar, and dwelt there. 
\v 18  And Isaac digged again the wells of water, which they had
digged in the days of Abraham his father; for the Philistines had
stopped them after the death of Abraham: and he called their names
after the names by which his father had called them. 
\v 19  And Isaac’s servants digged in the valley, and found there a
well of springing water.\f +  \ft springing: Heb. living\f* 
\v 20  And the herdmen of Gerar did strive with Isaac’s herdmen,
saying, The water \add is\add* ours: and he called the name of the
well Esek; because they strove with him.\f +  \ft Esek: that is,
Contention\f* 
\v 21  And they digged another well, and strove for that also: and he
called the name of it Sitnah.\f +  \ft Sitnah: that is, Hatred\f*
\v 22  And he removed from thence, and digged another well; and for that they
strove not: and he called the name of it Rehoboth; and he said, For
now the \nd LORD\nd* hath made room for us, and we shall be fruitful
in the land.\f +  \ft Rehoboth: that is Room\f* 
\v 23  And he went up from thence to Beer-sheba. 
\v 24  And the \nd LORD\nd* appeared  unto him the same night, and
said, I \add am\add* the God of Abraham thy father: fear not, for I
\add am\add* with thee, and will bless thee, and multiply thy seed
for my servant Abraham’s sake. 
\v 25  And he builded an altar there, and called upon the name of the
\nd LORD\nd*, and pitched his tent there: and there Isaac’s servants
digged a well. 
\p
\v 26 ¶ Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath one of his
friends, and Phichol the chief captain of his army. 
\v 27  And Isaac said unto them, Wherefore come ye to me, seeing ye
hate me, and have sent me away from you? 
\v 28  And they said, We saw certainly that the \nd LORD\nd* was with thee: and we
said, Let there be now an oath betwixt us, \add even\add* betwixt
us and thee, and let us make a covenant with thee;\f +  \ft We saw…: Heb. Seeing we
saw\f* 
\v 29  That thou wilt do us no hurt, as we have not touched thee, and as we have
done unto thee nothing but good, and have sent thee away in peace: thou
\add art\add* now the blessed of the \nd LORD\nd*.\f +  \ft That…: Heb. If thou
shalt\f* 
\v 30  And he made them a feast, and they did eat and drink. 
\v 31  And they rose up betimes in the morning, and sware one to
another: and Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in
peace. 
\v 32  And it came to pass the same day, that Isaac’s servants came,
and told him concerning the well which they had digged, and said
unto him, We have found water. 
\v 33  And he called it Shebah: therefore the name of the city \add is\add*
Beer-sheba unto this day.\f +  \ft Shebah: That is, an oath\f*\f + 
\ft Beer-sheba: that is, the well of the oath\f* 
\p
\v 34 ¶ And Esau was forty years old when he took to wife Judith
the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Bashemath the daughter of
Elon the Hittite: 
\v 35  Which were a grief of mind unto Isaac and to Rebekah.\f + 
\ft a grief…: Heb. bitterness of spirit\f* 
\c 27  
\p
\v 1  And it came to pass, that when Isaac was old, and his eyes
were dim, so that he could not see, he called Esau his eldest son,
and said unto him, My son: and he said unto him, Behold, \add here
am\add* I. 
\v 2  And he said, Behold now, I am old, I know not the day of my
death: 
\v 3  Now therefore take, I pray thee, thy weapons, thy quiver and thy
bow, and go out to the field, and take me \add some\add* venison;\f + 
\ft take: Heb. hunt\f* 
\v 4  And make me savoury meat, such as I love, and bring \add it\add*
to me, that I may eat; that my soul may bless thee before I die.
\v 5  And Rebekah heard when Isaac spake to Esau his son. And Esau
went to the field to hunt \add for\add* venison, \add and\add* to
bring \add it\add*. 
\p
\v 6 ¶ And Rebekah spake unto Jacob her son, saying, Behold, I heard
thy father speak unto Esau thy brother, saying, 
\v 7  Bring me venison, and make me savoury meat, that I may eat,
and bless thee before the \nd LORD\nd* before my death. 
\v 8  Now therefore, my son, obey my voice according to that which
I command thee. 
\v 9  Go now to the flock, and fetch me from thence two good kids
of the goats; and I will make them savoury meat for thy father, such as he
loveth: 
\v 10  And thou shalt bring \add it\add* to thy father, that he may
eat, and that he may bless thee before his death. 
\v 11  And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, Behold, Esau my brother
\add is\add* a hairy man, and I \add am\add* a smooth man: 
\v 12  My father peradventure will feel me, and I shall seem to him as a
deceiver; and I shall bring a curse upon me, and not a blessing.
\v 13  And his mother said unto him, Upon me \add be\add* thy curse,
my son: only obey my voice, and go fetch me \add them\add*. 
\v 14  And he went, and fetched, and brought \add them\add* to his
mother: and his mother made savoury meat, such as his father loved.
\v 15  And Rebekah took goodly raiment of her eldest son Esau, which
\add were\add* with her in the house, and put them upon Jacob her
younger son:\f +  \ft goodly: Heb. desirable\f* 
\v 16  And she put the skins of the kids of the goats upon his hands,
and upon the smooth of his neck: 
\v 17  And she gave the savoury meat and the bread, which she had
prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob. 
\p
\v 18 ¶ And he came unto his father, and said, My father: and he
said, Here \add am\add* I; who \add art\add* thou, my son? 
\v 19  And Jacob said unto his father, I \add am\add* Esau thy firstborn;
I have done according as thou badest me: arise, I pray thee, sit
and eat of my venison, that thy soul may bless me. 
\v 20  And Isaac said unto his son, How \add is it\add* that thou hast
found \add it\add* so quickly, my son? And he said, Because the \nd LORD\nd*
thy God brought \add it\add* to me.\f +  \ft to me: Heb. before me\f*
\v 21  And Isaac said unto Jacob, Come near, I pray thee, that I may
feel thee, my son, whether thou \add be\add* my very son Esau or not.
\v 22  And Jacob went near unto Isaac his father; and he felt him, and
said, The voice \add is\add* Jacob’s voice, but the hands \add are\add*
the hands of Esau. 
\v 23  And he discerned him not, because his hands were hairy, as his
brother Esau’s hands: so he blessed him. 
\v 24  And he said, \add Art\add* thou my very son Esau? And he said, I
\add am\add*. 
\v 25  And he said, Bring \add it\add* near to me, and I will eat
of my son’s venison, that my soul may bless thee. And he brought
\add it\add* near to him, and he did eat: and he brought him wine,
and he drank. 
\v 26  And his father Isaac said unto him, Come near now, and kiss
me, my son. 
\v 27  And he came near, and kissed him: and he smelled the smell
of his raiment, and blessed him, and said, See, the smell of my son
\add is\add* as the smell of a field which the \nd LORD\nd* hath
blessed: 
\v 28  Therefore God give thee of the dew of heaven, and the fatness
of the earth, and plenty of corn and wine: 
\v 29  Let people serve thee, and nations bow down to thee: be lord
over thy brethren, and let thy mother’s sons bow down to thee: cursed
\add be\add* every one that curseth thee, and blessed \add be\add*
he that blesseth thee. 
\p
\v 30 ¶ And it came to pass, as soon as Isaac had made an end of
blessing Jacob, and Jacob was yet scarce gone out from the presence
of Isaac his father, that Esau his brother came in from his hunting.
\v 31  And he also had made savoury meat, and brought it unto his
father, and said unto his father, Let my father arise, and eat of his
son’s venison, that thy soul may bless me. 
\v 32  And Isaac his father said unto him, Who \add art\add* thou? And he
said, I \add am\add* thy son, thy firstborn Esau. 
\v 33  And Isaac trembled very exceedingly, and said, Who? where
\add is\add* he that hath taken venison, and brought \add it\add*
me, and I have eaten of all before thou camest, and have blessed him? yea,
\add and\add* he shall be blessed.\f +  \ft trembled…: Heb. trembled with a great trembling
greatly\f*\f +  \ft taken: Heb. hunted\f* 
\v 34  And when Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with a
great and exceeding bitter cry, and said unto his father, Bless me,
\add even\add* me also, O my father. 
\v 35  And he said, Thy brother came with subtilty, and hath taken
away thy blessing. 
\v 36  And he said, Is not he rightly named Jacob? for he hath supplanted
me these two times: he took away my birthright; and, behold, now he hath taken
away my blessing. And he said, Hast thou not reserved a blessing for
me?\f +  \ft Jacob: that is, A supplanter\f* 
\v 37  And Isaac answered and said unto Esau, Behold, I have made
him thy lord, and all his brethren have I given to him for servants;
and with corn and wine have I sustained him: and what shall I do
now unto thee, my son?\f +  \ft sustained: or, supported\f* 
\v 38  And Esau said unto his father, Hast thou but one blessing,
my father? bless me, \add even\add* me also, O my father. And Esau
lifted up his voice, and wept. 
\v 39  And Isaac his father answered and said unto him, Behold, thy
dwelling shall be the fatness of the earth, and of the dew of heaven
from above;\f +  \ft the fatness: or, of the fatness\f* 
\v 40  And by thy sword shalt thou live, and shalt serve thy brother;
and it shall come to pass when thou shalt have the dominion, that thou shalt
break his yoke from off thy neck. 
\p
\v 41 ¶ And Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing wherewith his
father blessed him: and Esau said in his heart, The days of mourning
for my father are at hand; then will I slay my brother Jacob. 
\v 42  And these words of Esau her elder son were told to Rebekah:
and she sent and called Jacob her younger son, and said unto him, Behold, thy
brother Esau, as touching thee, doth comfort himself, \add purposing\add*
to kill thee. 
\v 43  Now therefore, my son, obey my voice; and arise, flee thou to
Laban my brother to Haran; 
\v 44  And tarry with him a few days, until thy brother’s fury turn
away; 
\v 45  Until thy brother’s anger turn away from thee, and he forget
\add that\add* which thou hast done to him: then I will send, and
fetch thee from thence: why should I be deprived also of you both
in one day? 
\v 46  And Rebekah said to Isaac, I am weary of my life because of the
daughters of Heth: if Jacob take a wife of the daughters of Heth, such as these
\add which are\add* of the daughters of the land, what good shall my
life do me? 
\c 28  
\p
\v 1  And Isaac called Jacob, and blessed him, and charged him, and
said unto him, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan.
\v 2  Arise, go to Padan-aram, to the house of Bethuel thy mother’s
father; and take thee a wife from thence of the daughters of Laban
thy mother’s brother. 
\v 3  And God Almighty bless thee, and make thee fruitful, and multiply
thee, that thou mayest be a multitude of people;\f +  \ft a multitude…: Heb. an assembly of

\v 4  And give thee the blessing of Abraham, to thee, and to thy
seed with thee; that thou mayest inherit the land wherein thou art a

sojournings\f* 
\v 5  And Isaac sent away Jacob: and he went to Padan-aram unto Laban,
son of Bethuel the Syrian, the brother of Rebekah, Jacob’s and Esau’s
mother. 
\p
\v 6 ¶ When Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob, and sent him away
to Padan-aram, to take him a wife from thence; and that as he blessed
him he gave him a charge, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife of the
daughters of Canaan; 
\v 7  And that Jacob obeyed his father and his mother, and was gone
to Padan-aram; 
\v 8  And Esau seeing that the daughters of Canaan pleased not Isaac
his father;\f +  \ft pleased…: Heb. were evil in the eyes, etc\f*
\v 9  Then went Esau unto Ishmael, and took unto the wives which he had
Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael Abraham’s son, the sister of Nebajoth,
to be his wife.\f +  \ft Mahalath: or, Bashemath\f* 
\p
\v 10 ¶ And Jacob went out from Beer-sheba, and went toward Haran.\f + 
\ft Haran: Gr. Charran\f* 
\v 11  And he lighted upon a certain place, and tarried there all
night, because the sun was set; and he took of the stones of that
place, and put \add them for\add* his pillows, and lay down in that
place to sleep. 
\v 12  And he dreamed, and behold a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of
it reached to heaven: and behold the angels of God ascending and
descending on it. 
\v 13  And, behold, the \nd LORD\nd* stood above it, and said, I
\add am\add* the \nd LORD\nd* God of Abraham thy father, and the
God of Isaac: the land whereon thou liest, to thee will I give it,
and to thy seed; 
\v 14  And thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth, and thou shalt spread
abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the
south: and in thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the
earth be blessed.\f +  \ft spread…: Heb. break forth\f* 
\v 15 And, behold, I \add am\add* with thee, and will keep thee in all
\add places\add* whither thou goest, and will bring thee again into this
land; for I will not leave thee, until I have done \add that\add*
which I have spoken to thee of. 
\p
\v 16 ¶ And Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and he said, Surely the
\nd LORD\nd* is in this place; and I knew \add it\add* not. 
\v 17  And he was afraid, and said, How dreadful \add is\add* this
place! this \add is\add* none other but the house of God, and this
\add is\add* the gate of heaven. 
\v 18  And Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone
that he had put \add for\add* his pillows, and set it up \add for\add*
a pillar, and poured oil upon the top of it. 
\v 19  And he called the name of that place Beth-el: but the name
of that city \add was called\add* Luz at the first.\f +  \ft Beth-el: that is, The house of

\v 20  And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If God will be with me, and will keep
me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and raiment
to put on, 
\v 21  So that I come again to my father’s house in peace; then shall the
\nd LORD\nd* be my God: 
\v 22  And this stone, which I have set \add for\add* a pillar, shall be
God’s house: and of all that thou shalt give me I will surely give the
tenth unto thee. 
\c 29  
\p
\v 1  Then Jacob went on his journey, and came into the land of the
people of the east.\f +  \ft went…: Heb. lift up his feet\f*\f + 
\ft people: Heb. children\f* 
\v 2  And he looked, and behold a well in the field, and, lo, there
\add were\add* three flocks of sheep lying by it; for out of that
well they watered the flocks: and a great stone \add was\add* upon the
well’s mouth. 
\v 3  And thither were all the flocks gathered: and they rolled the
stone from the well’s mouth, and watered the sheep, and put the stone
again upon the well’s mouth in his place. 
\v 4  And Jacob said unto them, My brethren, whence \add be\add*
ye? And they said, Of Haran \add are\add* we. 
\v 5  And he said unto them, Know ye Laban the son of Nahor? And they
said, We know \add him\add*. 
\v 6  And he said unto them, \add Is\add* he well? And they said,
\add He is\add* well: and, behold, Rachel his daughter cometh with the
sheep.\f +  \ft Is he…: Heb. Is there peace to him?\f* 
\v 7  And he said, Lo, \add it is\add* yet high day, neither \add is
it\add* time that the cattle should be gathered together: water ye the
sheep, and go \add and\add* feed \add them\add*.\f +  \ft it is…: Heb. yet the day is
great\f* 
\v 8  And they said, We cannot, until all the flocks be gathered
together, and \add till\add* they roll the stone from the well’s
mouth; then we water the sheep. 
\p
\v 9 ¶ And while he yet spake with them, Rachel came with her father’s
sheep: for she kept them. 
\v 10  And it came to pass, when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of
Laban his mother’s brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother’s brother,
that Jacob went near, and rolled the stone from the well’s mouth,
and watered the flock of Laban his mother’s brother. 
\v 11  And Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept.
\v 12  And Jacob told Rachel that he \add was\add* her father’s brother, and that he
\add was\add* Rebekah’s son: and she ran and told her father. 
\v 13  And it came to pass, when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob
his sister’s son, that he ran to meet him, and embraced him, and
kissed him, and brought him to his house. And he told Laban all these
things.\f +  \ft tidings: Heb. hearing\f* 
\v 14  And Laban said to him, Surely thou \add art\add* my bone and my
flesh. And he abode with him the space of a month.\f +  \ft the space…: Heb. a month of
days\f* 
\p
\v 15 ¶ And Laban said unto Jacob, Because thou \add art\add* my
brother, shouldest thou therefore serve me for nought? tell me, what
\add shall\add* thy wages \add be\add*? 
\v 16  And Laban had two daughters: the name of the elder \add was\add*
Leah, and the name of the younger \add was\add* Rachel. 
\v 17  Leah \add was\add* tender eyed; but Rachel was beautiful and
well favoured. 
\v 18  And Jacob loved Rachel; and said, I will serve thee seven
years for Rachel thy younger daughter. 
\v 19  And Laban said, \add It is\add* better that I give her to thee, than that I should
give her to another man: abide with me. 
\v 20  And Jacob served seven years for Rachel; and they seemed unto him
\add but\add* a few days, for the love he had to her. 
\p
\v 21 ¶ And Jacob said unto Laban, Give \add me\add* my wife, for my
days are fulfilled, that I may go in unto her. 
\v 22  And Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and
made a feast. 
\v 23  And it came to pass in the evening, that he took Leah his
daughter, and brought her to him; and he went in unto her. 
\v 24  And Laban gave unto his daughter Leah Zilpah his maid \add for\add*
an handmaid. 
\v 25  And it came to pass, that in the morning, behold, it \add was\add*
Leah: and he said to Laban, What \add is\add* this thou hast done
unto me? did not I serve with thee for Rachel? wherefore then hast thou
beguiled me? 
\v 26  And Laban said, It must not be so done in our country, to
give the younger before the firstborn.\f +  \ft country: Heb. place\f*
\v 27  Fulfil her week, and we will give thee this also for the service
which thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years. 
\v 28  And Jacob did so, and fulfilled her week: and he gave him
Rachel his daughter to wife also. 
\v 29  And Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah his handmaid
to be her maid. 
\v 30  And he went in also unto Rachel, and he loved also Rachel
more than Leah, and served with him yet seven other years. 
\p
\v 31 ¶ And when the \nd LORD\nd* saw that Leah \add was\add* hated,
he opened her womb: but Rachel \add was\add* barren. 
\v 32  And Leah conceived, and bare a son, and she called his name
Reuben: for she said, Surely the \nd LORD\nd* hath looked upon my
affliction; now therefore my husband will love me.\f +  \ft Reuben: that is, See a
son\f* 
\v 33  And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Because the
\nd LORD\nd* hath heard that I \add was\add* hated, he hath therefore
given me this \add son\add* also: and she called his name Simeon.\f + 
\ft Simeon: that is, Hearing\f* 
\v 34  And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Now this
time will my husband be joined unto me, because I have born him three
sons: therefore was his name called Levi.\f +  \ft Levi: that is,
Joined\f* 
\v 35  And she conceived again, and bare a son: and she said, Now
will I praise the \nd LORD\nd*: therefore she called his name Judah;
and left bearing.\f +  \ft Judah: that is, Praise\f*\f +  \ft left…: Heb. stood from
bearing\f* 
\c 30  
\p
\v 1  And when Rachel saw that she bare Jacob no children, Rachel
envied her sister; and said unto Jacob, Give me children, or else
I die. 
\v 2  And Jacob’s anger was kindled against Rachel: and he said,
\add Am\add* I in God’s stead, who hath withheld from thee the fruit
of the womb? 
\v 3  And she said, Behold my maid Bilhah, go in unto her; and she shall
bear upon my knees, that I may also have children by her.\f +  \ft have…: Heb. be built by
her\f* 
\v 4  And she gave him Bilhah her handmaid to wife: and Jacob went
in unto her. 
\v 5  And Bilhah conceived, and bare Jacob a son. 
\v 6  And Rachel said, God hath judged me, and hath also heard my
voice, and hath given me a son: therefore called she his name Dan.\f + 
\ft Dan: that is, Judging\f* 
\v 7  And Bilhah Rachel’s maid conceived again, and bare Jacob a
second son. 
\v 8  And Rachel said, With great wrestlings have I wrestled with my
sister, and I have prevailed: and she called his name Naphtali.\f + 
\ft great…: Heb. wrestlings of God\f*\f +  \ft Naphtali: that is, My wrestling: Gr.
Nephthalim\f* 
\v 9  When Leah saw that she had left bearing, she took Zilpah her
maid, and gave her Jacob to wife. 
\v 10  And Zilpah Leah’s maid bare Jacob a son. 
\v 11  And Leah said, A troop cometh: and she called his name Gad.\f + 
\ft Gad: that is, A troop, or, company\f* 
\v 12  And Zilpah Leah’s maid bare Jacob a second son. 
\v 13  And Leah said, Happy am I, for the daughters will call me
blessed: and she called his name Asher.\f +  \ft Happy…: Heb. In my
happiness\f*\f +  \ft Asher: that is, Happy\f* 
\p
\v 14 ¶ And Reuben went in the days of wheat harvest, and found mandrakes
in the field, and brought them unto his mother Leah. Then Rachel
said to Leah, Give me, I pray thee, of thy son’s mandrakes. 
\v 15  And she said unto her, \add Is it\add* a small matter that thou hast
taken my husband? and wouldest thou take away my son’s mandrakes
also? And Rachel said, Therefore he shall lie with thee to night
for thy son’s mandrakes. 
\v 16  And Jacob came out of the field in the evening, and Leah went
out to meet him, and said, Thou must come in unto me; for surely
I have hired thee with my son’s mandrakes. And he lay with her that
night. 
\v 17  And God hearkened unto Leah, and she conceived, and bare Jacob
the fifth son. 
\v 18  And Leah said, God hath given me my hire, because I have given
my maiden to my husband: and she called his name Issachar.\f +  \ft Issachar: that is, An
hire\f* 
\v 19  And Leah conceived again, and bare Jacob the sixth son. 
\v 20  And Leah said, God hath endued me \add with\add* a good dowry;
now will my husband dwell with me, because I have born him six sons:
and she called his name Zebulun.\f +  \ft Zebulun: that is, Dwelling: Gr.
Zabulon\f* 
\v 21  And afterwards she bare a daughter, and called her name Dinah.\f + 
\ft Dinah: that is Judgment\f* 
\p
\v 22 ¶ And God remembered Rachel, and God hearkened to her, and
opened her womb. 
\v 23  And she conceived, and bare a son; and said, God hath taken
away my reproach: 
\v 24  And she called his name Joseph; and said, The \nd LORD\nd*
shall add to me another son.\f +  \ft Joseph: that is, Adding\f*
\p
\v 25 ¶ And it came to pass, when Rachel had born Joseph, that Jacob
said unto Laban, Send me away, that I may go unto mine own place,
and to my country. 
\v 26  Give \add me\add* my wives and my children, for whom I have
served thee, and let me go: for thou knowest my service which I have
done thee. 
\v 27  And Laban said unto him, I pray thee, if I have found favour
in thine eyes, \add tarry: for\add* I have learned by experience
that the \nd LORD\nd* hath blessed me for thy sake. 
\v 28  And he said, Appoint me thy wages, and I will give \add it\add*.
\v 29  And he said unto him, Thou knowest how I have served thee, and
how thy cattle was with me. 
\v 30 For \add it was\add* little which thou hadst before I \add came\add*, and it is
\add now\add* increased unto a multitude; and the \nd LORD\nd* hath
blessed thee since my coming: and now when shall I provide for mine own
house also?\f +  \ft increased: Heb. broken forth\f*\f +  \ft since…: Heb. at my
foot\f* 
\v 31  And he said, What shall I give thee? And Jacob said, Thou shalt not
give me any thing: if thou wilt do this thing for me, I will again
feed \add and\add* keep thy flock: 
\v 32  I will pass through all thy flock to day, removing from thence all the
speckled and spotted cattle, and all the brown cattle among the sheep,
and the spotted and speckled among the goats: and \add of such\add*
shall be my hire. 
\v 33  So shall my righteousness answer for me in time to come, when it shall
come for my hire before thy face: every one that \add is\add* not
speckled and spotted among the goats, and brown among the sheep,
that shall be counted stolen with me.\f +  \ft in time…: Heb. to
morrow\f* 
\v 34  And Laban said, Behold, I would it might be according to thy
word. 
\v 35  And he removed that day the he goats that were ringstraked
and spotted, and all the she goats that were speckled and spotted,
\add and\add* every one that had \add some\add* white in it, and all the
brown among the sheep, and gave \add them\add* into the hand of his
sons. 
\v 36  And he set three days’ journey betwixt himself and Jacob:
and Jacob fed the rest of Laban’s flocks. 
\p
\v 37 ¶ And Jacob took him rods of green poplar, and of the hazel
and chesnut tree; and pilled white strakes in them, and made the
white appear which \add was\add* in the rods. 
\v 38  And he set the rods which he had pilled before the flocks
in the gutters in the watering troughs when the flocks came to drink,
that they should conceive when they came to drink. 
\v 39  And the flocks conceived before the rods, and brought forth
cattle ringstraked, speckled, and spotted. 
\v 40  And Jacob did separate the lambs, and set the faces of the
flocks toward the ringstraked, and all the brown in the flock of
Laban; and he put his own flocks by themselves, and put them not unto
Laban’s cattle. 
\v 41  And it came to pass, whensoever the stronger cattle did conceive,
that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the cattle in the gutters,
that they might conceive among the rods. 
\v 42  But when the cattle were feeble, he put \add them\add* not
in: so the feebler were Laban’s, and the stronger Jacob’s. 
\v 43  And the man increased exceedingly, and had much cattle, and
maidservants, and menservants, and camels, and asses. 
\c 31  
\p
\v 1  And he heard the words of Laban’s sons, saying, Jacob hath taken
away all that \add was\add* our father’s; and of \add that\add* which
\add was\add* our father’s hath he gotten all this glory. 
\v 2  And Jacob beheld the countenance of Laban, and, behold, it
\add was\add* not toward him as before.\f +  \ft as before: Heb. as yesterday and the day
before\f* 
\v 3  And the \nd LORD\nd* said unto Jacob, Return unto the land
of thy fathers, and to thy kindred; and I will be with thee. 
\v 4  And Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field unto his
flock, 
\v 5  And said unto them, I see your father’s countenance, that it
\add is\add* not toward me as before; but the God of my father hath
been with me. 
\v 6  And ye know that with all my power I have served your father.
\v 7  And your father hath deceived me, and changed my wages ten
times; but God suffered him not to hurt me. 
\v 8  If he said thus, The speckled shall be thy wages; then all the
cattle bare speckled: and if he said thus, The ringstraked shall be thy
hire; then bare all the cattle ringstraked. 
\v 9  Thus God hath taken away the cattle of your father, and given
\add them\add* to me. 
\v 10  And it came to pass at the time that the cattle conceived,
that I lifted up mine eyes, and saw in a dream, and, behold, the
rams which leaped upon the cattle \add were\add* ringstraked, speckled,
and grisled.\f +  \ft rams: or, he goats\f* 
\v 11  And the angel of God spake unto me in a dream, \add saying\add*,
Jacob: And I said, Here \add am\add* I. 
\v 12  And he said, Lift up now thine eyes, and see, all the rams
which leap upon the cattle \add are\add* ringstraked, speckled, and
grisled: for I have seen all that Laban doeth unto thee. 
\v 13 I \add am\add* the God of Beth-el, where thou anointedst the
pillar, \add and\add* where thou vowedst a vow unto me: now arise,
get thee out from this land, and return unto the land of thy kindred.
\v 14  And Rachel and Leah answered and said unto him, \add Is there\add*
yet any portion or inheritance for us in our father’s house? 
\v 15  Are we not counted of him strangers? for he hath sold us, and hath
quite devoured also our money. 
\v 16  For all the riches which God hath taken from our father, that
\add is\add* ours, and our children’s: now then, whatsoever God hath
said unto thee, do. 
\p
\v 17 ¶ Then Jacob rose up, and set his sons and his wives upon camels;
\v 18  And he carried away all his cattle, and all his goods which he had
gotten, the cattle of his getting, which he had gotten in Padan-aram,
for to go to Isaac his father in the land of Canaan. 
\v 19  And Laban went to shear his sheep: and Rachel had stolen the
images that \add were\add* her father’s.\f +  \ft images: Heb. teraphim\f*
\v 20  And Jacob stole away unawares to Laban the Syrian, in that
he told him not that he fled.\f +  \ft unawares…: Heb. the heart of
Laban\f* 
\v 21  So he fled with all that he had; and he rose up, and passed
over the river, and set his face \add toward\add* the mount Gilead.
\v 22  And it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob was fled.
\v 23  And he took his brethren with him, and pursued after him seven
days’ journey; and they overtook him in the mount Gilead. 
\v 24  And God came to Laban the Syrian in a dream by night, and
said unto him, Take heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good
or bad.\f +  \ft either…: Heb. from good to bad\f* 
\p
\v 25 ¶ Then Laban overtook Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent
in the mount: and Laban with his brethren pitched in the mount of
Gilead. 
\v 26  And Laban said to Jacob, What hast thou done, that thou hast stolen
away unawares to me, and carried away my daughters, as captives \add taken\add*
with the sword? 
\v 27  Wherefore didst thou flee away secretly, and steal away from me; and didst not
tell me, that I might have sent thee away with mirth, and with songs,
with tabret, and with harp?\f +  \ft steal…: Heb. hast stolen me\f*
\v 28  And hast not suffered me to kiss my sons and my daughters?
thou hast now done foolishly in \add so\add* doing. 
\v 29  It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt: but the God
of your father spake unto me yesternight, saying, Take thou heed
that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad. 
\v 30 And now, \add though\add* thou wouldest needs be gone, because thou
sore longedst after thy father’s house, \add yet\add* wherefore hast thou
stolen my gods? 
\v 31  And Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was afraid:
for I said, Peradventure thou wouldest take by force thy daughters from me.
\v 32  With whomsoever thou findest thy gods, let him not live: before
our brethren discern thou what \add is\add* thine with me, and take
\add it\add* to thee. For Jacob knew not that Rachel had stolen them.
\v 33  And Laban went into Jacob’s tent, and into Leah’s tent, and into the
two maidservants’ tents; but he found \add them\add* not. Then went he
out of Leah’s tent, and entered into Rachel’s tent. 
\v 34  Now Rachel had taken the images, and put them in the camel’s
furniture, and sat upon them. And Laban searched all the tent, but
found \add them\add* not.\f +  \ft searched: Heb. felt\f* 
\v 35  And she said to her father, Let it not displease my lord that I
cannot rise up before thee; for the custom of women \add is\add*
upon me. And he searched, but found not the images. 
\p
\v 36 ¶ And Jacob was wroth, and chode with Laban: and Jacob answered
and said to Laban, What \add is\add* my trespass? what \add is\add*
my sin, that thou hast so hotly pursued after me? 
\v 37  Whereas thou hast searched all my stuff, what hast thou found
of all thy household stuff? set \add it\add* here before my brethren
and thy brethren, that they may judge betwixt us both.\f +  \ft searched: Heb.
felt\f* 
\v 38  This twenty years \add have\add* I \add been\add* with thee; thy
ewes and thy she goats have not cast their young, and the rams of thy
flock have I not eaten. 
\v 39  That which was torn \add of beasts\add* I brought not unto thee; I bare the
loss of it; of my hand didst thou require it, \add whether\add* stolen
by day, or stolen by night. 
\v 40  \add Thus\add* I was; in the day the drought consumed me, and the
frost by night; and my sleep departed  from mine eyes. 
\v 41  Thus have I been twenty years in thy house; I served thee
fourteen years for thy two daughters, and six years for thy cattle:
and thou hast changed my wages ten times. 
\v 42  Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear
of Isaac, had been with me, surely thou hadst sent me away now empty.
God hath seen mine affliction and the labour of my hands, and rebuked
\add thee\add* yesternight. 
\p
\v 43 ¶ And Laban answered and said unto Jacob, \add These\add* daughters
\add are\add* my daughters, and \add these\add* children \add are\add*
my children, and \add these\add* cattle \add are\add* my cattle,
and all that thou seest \add is\add* mine: and what can I do this
day unto these my daughters, or unto their children which they have
born? 
\v 44  Now therefore come thou, let us make a covenant, I and thou; and let it be for a
witness between me and thee. 
\v 45  And Jacob took a stone, and set it up \add for\add* a pillar.
\v 46  And Jacob said unto his brethren, Gather stones; and they
took stones, and made an heap: and they did eat there upon the heap.
\v 47  And Laban called it Jegar-sahadutha: but Jacob called it Galeed.\f + 
\ft Jegar-sahadutha: that is, The heap of witness, Chaldee\f*\f + 
\ft Galeed: that is, The heap of witness, Heb.\f* 
\v 48  And Laban said, This heap \add is\add* a witness between me and thee this
day. Therefore was the name of it called Galeed; 
\v 49  And Mizpah; for he said, The \nd LORD\nd* watch between me and thee, when we are
absent one from another.\f +  \ft Mizpah: that is, A beacon, or,
watchtower\f* 
\v 50  If thou shalt afflict my daughters, or if thou shalt take
\add other\add* wives beside my daughters, no man \add is\add* with us;
see, God \add is\add* witness betwixt me and thee. 
\v 51  And Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap, and behold \add this\add*
pillar, which I have cast betwixt me and thee; 
\v 52  This heap \add be\add* witness, and \add this\add* pillar
\add be\add* witness, that I will not pass over this heap to thee, and that thou shalt not pass
over this heap and this pillar unto me, for harm. 
\v 53  The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their
father, judge betwixt us. And Jacob sware by the fear of his father
Isaac. 
\v 54  Then Jacob offered sacrifice upon the mount, and called his
brethren to eat bread: and they did eat bread, and tarried all night
in the mount.\f +  \ft offered…: or, killed beasts\f* 
\v 55  And early in the morning Laban rose up, and kissed his sons
and his daughters, and blessed them: and Laban departed, and returned
unto his place. 
\c 32  
\p
\v 1  And Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him. 
\v 2  And when Jacob saw them, he said, This \add is\add* God’s host:
and he called the name of that place Mahanaim.\f +  \ft Mahanaim: that is, Two hosts, or,

\p
\v 3  And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother unto the
land of Seir, the country of Edom.\f +  \ft country: Heb. field\f*
\v 4  And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye speak unto my
lord Esau; Thy servant Jacob saith thus, I have sojourned with Laban,
and stayed there until now: 
\v 5  And I have oxen, and asses, flocks, and menservants, and womenservants:
and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find grace in thy sight.
\p
\v 6 ¶ And the messengers returned  to Jacob, saying, We came to thy
brother Esau, and also he cometh to meet thee, and four hundred men with him.
\v 7  Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed: and he divided
the people that \add was\add* with him, and the flocks, and herds,
and the camels, into two bands; 
\v 8  And said, If Esau come to the one company, and smite it, then the other
company which is left shall escape. 
\p
\v 9 ¶ And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my
father Isaac, the \nd LORD\nd* which saidst unto me, Return unto thy
country, and to thy kindred, and I will deal well with thee: 
\v 10  I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies, and of all the
truth, which thou hast shewed unto thy servant; for with my staff
I passed over this Jordan; and now I am become two bands.\f +  \ft I am not…: Heb. I am less than
all\f* 
\v 11  Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the
hand of Esau: for I fear him, lest he will come and smite me, \add and\add*
the mother with the children.\f +  \ft with: Heb. upon\f* 
\v 12  And thou saidst, I will surely do thee good, and make thy
seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.
\p
\v 13 ¶ And he lodged there that same night; and took of that which
came to his hand a present for Esau his brother; 
\v 14  Two hundred she goats, and twenty he goats, two hundred ewes,
and twenty rams, 
\v 15  Thirty milch camels with their colts, forty kine, and ten
bulls, twenty she asses, and ten foals. 
\v 16  And he delivered \add them\add* into the hand of his servants,
every drove by themselves; and said unto his servants, Pass over
before me, and put a space betwixt drove and drove. 
\v 17  And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother
meeteth thee, and asketh thee, saying, Whose \add art\add* thou? and whither
goest thou? and whose \add are\add* these before thee? 
\v 18  Then thou shalt say, \add They be\add* thy servant Jacob’s; it
\add is\add* a present sent unto my lord Esau: and, behold, also he
\add is\add* behind us. 
\v 19  And so commanded he the second, and the third, and all that
followed the droves, saying, On this manner shall ye speak unto Esau,
when ye find him. 
\v 20  And say ye moreover, Behold, thy servant Jacob \add is\add*
behind us. For he said, I will appease him with the present that
goeth before me, and afterward I will see his face; peradventure he will
accept of me.\f +  \ft of me: Heb. my face\f* 
\v 21  So went the present over before him: and himself lodged that
night in the company. 
\v 22  And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his
two womenservants, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford
Jabbok. 
\v 23  And he took them, and sent them over the brook, and sent over that he
had.\f +  \ft sent them: Heb. caused to pass\f* 
\p
\v 24 ¶ And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until the

\v 25  And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched
the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob’s thigh was out of
joint, as he wrestled with him. 
\v 26  And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh. And he said,
I will not let thee go, except thou bless me. 
\v 27  And he said unto him, What \add is\add* thy name? And he said,
Jacob. 
\v 28  And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel:
for as a prince hast thou power with God and with men, and hast prevailed.\f + 
\ft Israel: that is, A prince of God\f* 
\v 29  And Jacob asked \add him\add*, and said, Tell \add me\add*,
I pray thee, thy name. And he said, Wherefore \add is\add* it \add that\add*
thou dost ask after my name? And he blessed him there. 
\v 30  And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for I have
seen God face to face, and my life is preserved.\f +  \ft Peniel: that is, The face of
God\f* 
\v 31  And as he passed over Penuel the sun rose upon him, and he
halted upon his thigh. 
\v 32  Therefore the children of Israel eat not \add of\add* the
sinew which shrank, which \add is\add* upon the hollow of the thigh,
unto this day: because he touched the hollow of Jacob’s thigh in the
sinew that shrank. 
\c 33  
\p
\v 1  And Jacob lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, Esau
came, and with him four hundred men. And he divided the children
unto Leah, and unto Rachel, and unto the two handmaids. 
\v 2  And he put the handmaids and their children foremost, and Leah
and her children after, and Rachel and Joseph hindermost. 
\v 3  And he passed over before them, and bowed himself to the ground
seven times, until he came near to his brother. 
\v 4  And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his
neck, and kissed him: and they wept. 
\p
\v 5  And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children;
and said, Who \add are\add* those with thee? And he said, The children
which God hath graciously given thy servant.\f +  \ft with…: Heb. to
thee\f* 
\v 6  Then the handmaidens came near, they and their children, and they bowed
themselves. 
\v 7  And Leah also with her children came near, and bowed themselves:
and after came Joseph near and Rachel, and they bowed themselves.
\v 8  And he said, What \add meanest\add* thou by all this drove
which I met? And he said, \add These are\add* to find grace in the
sight of my lord.\f +  \ft What…: Heb. What is all this band to thee?\f*
\v 9  And Esau said, I have enough, my brother; keep that thou hast unto
thyself.\f +  \ft keep…: Heb. be that to thee that is thine\f* 
\v 10  And Jacob said, Nay, I pray thee, if now I have found grace
in thy sight, then receive my present at my hand: for therefore I have
seen thy face, as though I had seen the face of God, and thou wast pleased with
me. 
\v 11  Take, I pray thee, my blessing that is brought to thee; because
God hath dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough. And he
urged him, and he took \add it\add*.\f +  \ft enough: Heb. all things\f*
\v 12  And he said, Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I will
go before thee. 
\v 13  And he said unto him, My lord knoweth that the children \add are\add*
tender, and the flocks and herds with young \add are\add* with me: and if men should
overdrive them one day, all the flock will die. 
\v 14  Let my lord, I pray thee, pass over before his servant: and I will lead
on softly, according as the cattle that goeth before me and the children
be able to endure, until I come unto my lord unto Seir.\f +  \ft according…: Heb. according to the foot of the work, etc., and
according to the foot of the children\f* 
\v 15  And Esau said, Let me now leave with thee \add some\add* of the

find grace in the sight of my lord.\f +  \ft leave: Heb. set, or,

\p
\v 16 ¶ So Esau returned that day on his way unto Seir. 
\v 17  And Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built him an house, and
made booths for his cattle: therefore the name of the place is called
Succoth.\f +  \ft Succoth: that is, Booths\f* 
\p
\v 18 ¶ And Jacob came to Shalem, a city of Shechem, which \add is\add*
in the land of Canaan, when he came from Padan-aram; and pitched his
tent before the city.\f +  \ft Shechem: Gr. Sychem\f* 
\v 19  And he bought a parcel of a field, where he had spread his
tent, at the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechem’s father, for an
hundred pieces of money.\f +  \ft Hamor: Gr. Emmor\f*\f +  \ft pieces…: or,

\v 20  And he erected there an altar, and called it El-elohe-Israel.\f + 
\ft El-elohe-Israel: that is God the God of Israel\f* 
\c 34  
\p
\v 1  And Dinah the daughter of Leah, which she bare unto Jacob,
went out to see the daughters of the land. 
\v 2  And when Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, prince of the
country, saw her, he took her, and lay with her, and defiled her.\f + 
\ft defiled…: Heb. humbled her\f* 
\v 3  And his soul clave unto Dinah the daughter of Jacob, and he
loved the damsel, and spake kindly unto the damsel.\f +  \ft kindly…: Heb. to the heart of the
damsel\f* 
\v 4  And Shechem spake unto his father Hamor, saying, Get me this
damsel to wife. 
\v 5  And Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter: now his
sons were with his cattle in the field: and Jacob held his peace
until they were come. 
\p
\v 6 ¶ And Hamor the father of Shechem went out unto Jacob to commune
with him. 
\v 7  And the sons of Jacob came out of the field when they heard
\add it:\add* and the men were grieved, and they were very wroth,
because he had wrought folly in Israel in lying with Jacob’s daughter;
which thing ought not to be done. 
\v 8  And Hamor communed with them, saying, The soul of my son Shechem
longeth for your daughter: I pray you give her him to wife. 
\v 9  And make ye marriages with us, \add and\add* give your daughters
unto us, and take our daughters unto you. 
\v 10  And ye shall dwell with us: and the land shall be before you;
dwell and trade ye therein, and get you possessions therein. 
\v 11  And Shechem said unto her father and unto her brethren, Let me
find grace in your eyes, and what ye shall say unto me I will give.
\v 12  Ask me never so much dowry and gift, and I will give according as ye shall
say unto me: but give me the damsel to wife. 
\v 13  And the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father
deceitfully, and said, because he had defiled Dinah their sister:
\v 14  And they said unto them, We cannot do this thing, to give
our sister to one that is uncircumcised; for that \add were\add*
a reproach unto us: 
\v 15  But in this will we consent unto you: If ye will be as we
\add be\add*, that every male of you be circumcised; 
\v 16  Then will we give our daughters unto you, and we will take
your daughters to us, and we will dwell with you, and we will become
one people. 
\v 17  But if ye will not hearken unto us, to be circumcised; then will we
take our daughter, and we will be gone. 
\p
\v 18  And their words pleased  Hamor, and Shechem Hamor’s son. 
\v 19  And the young man deferred not to do the thing, because he had
delight in Jacob’s daughter: and he \add was\add* more honourable
than all the house of his father. 
\p
\v 20 ¶ And Hamor and Shechem his son came unto the gate of their
city, and communed with the men of their city, saying, 
\v 21  These men \add are\add* peaceable with us; therefore let them
dwell in the land, and trade therein; for the land, behold, \add it
is\add* large enough for them; let us take their daughters to us for
wives, and let us give them our daughters. 
\v 22  Only herein will the men consent unto us for to dwell with us, to be
one people, if every male among us be circumcised, as they \add are\add*
circumcised. 
\v 23  \add Shall\add* not their cattle and their substance and every
beast of theirs \add be\add* ours? only let us consent unto them, and they will
dwell with us. 
\v 24  And unto Hamor and unto Shechem his son hearkened all that went
out of the gate of his city; and every male was circumcised, all that went
out of the gate of his city. 
\p
\v 25 ¶ And it came to pass on the third day, when they were sore,
that two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah’s brethren,
took each man his sword, and came upon the city boldly, and slew
all the males. 
\v 26  And they slew Hamor and Shechem his son with the edge of the
sword, and took Dinah out of Shechem’s house, and went out.\f + 
\ft edge: Heb. mouth\f* 
\v 27  The sons of Jacob came upon the slain, and spoiled the city,
because they had defiled their sister. 
\v 28  They took their sheep, and their oxen, and their asses, and that which
\add was\add* in the city, and that which \add was\add* in the field,
\v 29  And all their wealth, and all their little ones, and their
wives took they captive, and spoiled even all that \add was\add*
in the house. 
\v 30  And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, Ye have troubled me to make me to
stink among the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites and the
Perizzites: and I \add being\add* few in number, they shall gather themselves
together against me, and slay me; and I shall be destroyed, I and my
house. 
\v 31  And they said, Should he deal with our sister as with an harlot?
\c 35  
\p
\v 1  And God said unto Jacob, Arise, go up to Beth-el, and dwell
there: and make there an altar unto God, that appeared unto thee when thou
fleddest from the face of Esau thy brother. 
\v 2  Then Jacob said unto his household, and to all that \add were\add*
with him, Put away the strange gods that \add are\add* among you,
and be clean, and change your garments: 
\v 3  And let us arise, and go up to Beth-el; and I will make there an
altar unto God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me in the
way which I went. 
\v 4  And they gave unto Jacob all the strange gods which \add were\add*
in their hand, and \add all their\add* earrings which \add were\add*
in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the oak which \add was\add*
by Shechem. 
\v 5  And they journeyed: and the terror of God was upon the cities that
\add were\add* round about them, and they did not pursue after the
sons of Jacob. 
\p
\v 6 ¶ So Jacob came to Luz, which \add is\add* in the land of Canaan, that
\add is\add*, Beth-el, he and all the people that \add were\add* with him.
\v 7  And he built there an altar, and called the place El-beth-el:
because there God appeared unto him, when he fled from the face of his
brother.\f +  \ft El-beth-el: that is, The God of Beth-el\f* 
\v 8  But Deborah Rebekah’s nurse died, and she was buried beneath
Beth-el under an oak: and the name of it was called Allon-bachuth.\f + 
\ft Allon-bachuth: that is, The oak of weeping\f* 
\p
\v 9 ¶ And God appeared unto Jacob again, when he came out of Padan-aram,
and blessed him. 
\v 10  And God said unto him, Thy name \add is\add* Jacob: thy name
shall not be called any more Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name:
and he called his name Israel. 
\v 11  And God said unto him, I \add am\add* God Almighty: be fruitful
and multiply; a nation and a company of nations shall be of thee, and
kings shall come out of thy loins; 
\v 12  And the land which I gave Abraham and Isaac, to thee I will give
it, and to thy seed after thee will I give the land. 
\v 13  And God went up from him in the place where he talked with him.
\v 14  And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he talked with him,
\add even\add* a pillar of stone: and he poured a drink offering
thereon, and he poured oil thereon. 
\v 15  And Jacob called the name of the place where God spake with him,
Beth-el. 
\p
\v 16 ¶ And they journeyed from Beth-el; and there was but a little
way to come to Ephrath: and Rachel travailed, and she had hard labour.\f + 
\ft a little…: Heb. a little piece of ground\f* 
\v 17  And it came to pass, when she was in hard labour, that the
midwife said unto her, Fear not; thou shalt have this son also. 
\v 18  And it came to pass, as her soul was in departing, (for she
died) that she called his name Ben-oni: but his father called him
Benjamin.\f +  \ft Ben-oni: that is, The son of my sorrow\f*\f + 
\ft Benjamin: that is, The son of the right hand\f* 
\v 19  And Rachel died, and was buried in the way to Ephrath, which
\add is\add* Beth-lehem. 
\v 20  And Jacob set a pillar upon her grave: that \add is\add* the
pillar of Rachel’s grave unto this day. 
\p
\v 21 ¶ And Israel journeyed, and spread his tent beyond the tower
of Edar. 
\v 22  And it came to pass, when Israel dwelt in that land, that
Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father’s concubine: and Israel
heard \add it\add*. Now the sons of Jacob were twelve: 
\v 23  The sons of Leah; Reuben, Jacob’s firstborn, and Simeon, and
Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Zebulun: 
\v 24  The sons of Rachel; Joseph, and Benjamin: 
\v 25  And the sons of Bilhah, Rachel’s handmaid; Dan, and Naphtali:
\v 26  And the sons of Zilpah, Leah’s handmaid; Gad, and Asher: these
\add are\add* the sons of Jacob, which were born to him in Padan-aram.
\p
\v 27 ¶ And Jacob came unto Isaac his father unto Mamre, unto the city of
Arbah, which \add is\add* Hebron, where Abraham and Isaac sojourned.
\v 28  And the days of Isaac were an hundred and fourscore years.
\v 29  And Isaac gave up the ghost, and died, and was gathered unto his

\v 1 Now these \add are\add* the generations of Esau, who \add is\add*

\v 6  And Esau took his wives, and his sons, and his daughters, and all the

substance, which he had got in the land of Canaan; and went into the
country from the face of his brother Jacob.\f +  \ft persons: Heb.

\v 7  For their riches were more than that they might dwell together;
and the land wherein they were strangers could not bear them because

\v 8  Thus dwelt Esau in mount Seir: Esau \add is\add* Edom.

and they hated him yet the more. 
\v 6  And he said unto them, Hear, I pray you, this dream which I have

\v 7 For, behold, we \add were\add* binding sheaves in the field,
and, lo, my sheaf arose, and also stood upright; and, behold, your

\v 8  And his brethren said to him, Shalt thou indeed reign over us? or shalt thou

\p
\v 9 ¶ And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it his brethren,
and said, Behold, I have dreamed a dream more; and, behold, the sun

\v 10  And he told \add it\add* to his father, and to his brethren:
and his father rebuked him, and said unto him, What \add is\add*

\v 11  And his brethren envied him; but his father observed the saying.
\p
\v 12 ¶ And his brethren went to feed their father’s flock in Shechem.

found them in Dothan. 
\v 18  And when they saw him afar off, even before he came near unto them, they

\v 21  And Reuben heard \add it\add*, and he delivered him out of their

\v 26  And Judah said unto his brethren, What profit \add is it\add*

for twenty \add pieces\add* of silver: and they brought Joseph into
Egypt. 
\p
\v 29 ¶ And Reuben returned unto the pit; and, behold, Joseph \add was\add*
not in the pit; and he rent his clothes. 
\v 30  And he returned unto his brethren, and said, The child \add is\add*
not; and I, whither shall I go? 
\p
\v 31  And they took Joseph’s coat, and killed a kid of the goats,
and dipped the coat in the blood; 
\v 32  And they sent the coat of \add many\add* colours, and they
brought \add it\add* to their father; and said, This have we found:
know now whether it \add be\add* thy son’s coat or no. 
\v 33  And he knew it, and said, \add It is\add* my son’s coat; an
evil beast hath devoured him; Joseph is without doubt rent in pieces.
\v 34  And Jacob rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his loins,
and mourned for his son many days. 
\v 35  And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort
him; but he refused to be comforted; and he said, For I will go down
into the grave unto my son mourning. Thus his father wept for him.
\v 36  And the Midianites sold him into Egypt unto Potiphar, an officer
of Pharaoh’s, \add and\add* captain of the guard.\f +  \ft officer: Heb. eunuch: but the word doth signify not only eunuchs,
but also chamberlains, courtiers, and officers\f*\f +  \ft captain…: or, chief marshal: Heb. chief of the slaughter men, or
executioners\f* 
\c 38  
\p
\v 1  And it came to pass at that time, that Judah went down from his
brethren, and turned in to a certain Adullamite, whose name \add was\add*
Hirah. 
\v 2  And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite, whose
name \add was\add* Shuah; and he took her, and went in unto her.
\v 3  And she conceived, and bare a son; and he called his name Er.
\v 4  And she conceived again, and bare a son; and she called his
name Onan. 
\v 5  And she yet again conceived, and bare a son; and called his
name Shelah: and he was at Chezib, when she bare him. 
\v 6  And Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, whose name \add was\add*
Tamar. 
\v 7  And Er, Judah’s firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the \nd LORD\nd*;
and the \nd LORD\nd* slew him. 
\v 8  And Judah said unto Onan, Go in unto thy brother’s wife, and
marry her, and raise up seed to thy brother. 
\v 9  And Onan knew that the seed should not be his; and it came to pass,
when he went in unto his brother’s wife, that he spilled \add it\add*
on the ground, lest that he should give seed to his brother. 
\v 10  And the thing which he did displeased the \nd LORD\nd*: wherefore he
slew him also.\f +  \ft displeased…: Heb. was evil in the eyes of the
Lord\f* 
\v 11  Then said Judah to Tamar his daughter in law, Remain a widow
at thy father’s house, till Shelah my son be grown: for he said,
Lest peradventure he die also, as his brethren \add did\add*. And
Tamar went and dwelt in her father’s house. 
\p
\v 12 ¶ And in process of time the daughter of Shuah Judah’s wife
died; and Judah was comforted, and went up unto his sheepshearers
to Timnath, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite.\f +  \ft in process…: Heb. the days were
multiplied\f* 
\v 13  And it was told Tamar, saying, Behold thy father in law goeth
up to Timnath to shear his sheep. 
\v 14  And she put her widow’s garments off from her, and covered
her with a vail, and wrapped herself, and sat in an open place, which
\add is\add* by the way to Timnath; for she saw that Shelah was grown,
and she was not given unto him to wife.\f +  \ft an open…: Heb. the door of eyes, or, of
Enajim\f* 
\v 15  When Judah saw her, he thought her \add to be\add* an harlot;
because she had covered her face. 
\v 16  And he turned unto her by the way, and said, Go to, I pray thee, let me come
in unto thee; (for he knew not that she \add was\add* his daughter in
law.) And she said, What wilt thou give me, that thou mayest come
in unto me? 
\v 17  And he said, I will send \add thee\add* a kid from the flock.
And she said, Wilt thou give \add me\add* a pledge, till thou send
\add it\add*?\f +  \ft a kid: Heb. a kid of the goats\f* 
\v 18  And he said, What pledge shall I give thee? And she said,
Thy signet, and thy bracelets, and thy staff that \add is\add* in thine
hand. And he gave \add it\add* her, and came in unto her, and she
conceived by him. 
\v 19  And she arose, and went away, and laid by her vail from her, and put
on the garments of her widowhood. 
\v 20  And Judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the Adullamite,
to receive \add his\add* pledge from the woman’s hand: but he found
her not. 
\v 21  Then he asked the men of that place, saying, Where \add is\add*
the harlot, that \add was\add* openly by the way side? And they said,
There was no harlot in this \add place\add*.\f +  \ft openly: or, in
Enajim\f* 
\v 22  And he returned to Judah, and said, I cannot find her; and also the
men of the place said, \add that\add* there was no harlot in this
\add place\add*. 
\v 23  And Judah said, Let her take \add it\add* to her, lest we be
shamed: behold, I sent this kid, and thou hast not found her.\f + 
\ft be shamed: Heb. become a contempt\f* 
\p
\v 24 ¶ And it came to pass about three months after, that it was
told Judah, saying, Tamar thy daughter in law hath played the harlot; and also, behold, she
\add is\add* with child by whoredom. And Judah said, Bring her forth,
and let her be burnt. 
\v 25 When she \add was\add* brought forth, she sent to her father in
law, saying, By the man, whose these \add are, am\add* I with child:
and she said, Discern, I pray thee, whose \add are\add* these, the
signet, and bracelets, and staff. 
\v 26  And Judah acknowledged \add them\add*, and said, She hath been more
righteous than I; because that I gave her not to Shelah my son. And he knew
her again no more. 
\p
\v 27 ¶ And it came to pass in the time of her travail, that, behold,
twins \add were\add* in her womb. 
\v 28  And it came to pass, when she travailed, that \add the one\add*
put out \add his\add* hand: and the midwife took and bound upon his
hand a scarlet thread, saying, This came out first. 
\v 29  And it came to pass, as he drew back his hand, that, behold, his
brother came out: and she said, How hast thou broken forth? \add this\add*
breach \add be\add* upon thee: therefore his name was called Pharez.\f + 
\ft How hast…: or, Wherefore hast thou made this breach against thee?\f*\f + 
\ft Pharez: that is A breach\f* 
\v 30  And afterward came out his brother, that had the scarlet thread
upon his hand: and his name was called Zarah. 
\c 39  
\p
\v 1  And Joseph was brought down to Egypt; and Potiphar, an officer
of Pharaoh, captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him of the
hands of the Ishmeelites, which had brought him down thither. 
\v 2  And the \nd LORD\nd* was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous
man; and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian. 
\v 3  And his master saw that the \nd LORD\nd* \add was\add* with him, and that the
\nd LORD\nd* made all that he did to prosper in his hand. 
\v 4  And Joseph found grace in his sight, and he served him: and he made him
overseer over his house, and all \add that\add* he had he put into his
hand. 
\v 5  And it came to pass from the time \add that\add* he had made him
overseer in his house, and over all that he had, that the \nd LORD\nd*
blessed the Egyptian’s house for Joseph’s sake; and the blessing
of the \nd LORD\nd* was upon all that he had in the house, and in the
field. 
\v 6  And he left all that he had in Joseph’s hand; and he knew not
ought he had, save the bread which he did eat. And Joseph was \add a\add*
goodly \add person\add*, and well favoured. 
\p
\v 7 ¶ And it came to pass after these things, that his master’s
wife cast her eyes upon Joseph; and she said, Lie with me. 
\v 8  But he refused, and said unto his master’s wife, Behold, my
master wotteth not what \add is\add* with me in the house, and he hath
committed all that he hath to my hand; 
\v 9  \add There is\add* none greater in this house than I; neither
hath he kept back any thing from me but thee, because thou \add art\add*
his wife: how then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against
God? 
\v 10  And it came to pass, as she spake to Joseph day by day, that he
hearkened not unto her, to lie by her, \add or\add* to be with her.
\v 11  And it came to pass about this time, that \add Joseph\add*
went into the house to do his business; and \add there was\add* none of the
men of the house there within. 
\v 12  And she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me: and he
left his garment in her hand, and fled, and got him out. 
\p
\v 13  And it came to pass, when she saw that he had left his garment
in her hand, and was fled forth, 
\v 14  That she called unto the men of her house, and spake unto them,
saying, See, he hath brought in an Hebrew unto us to mock us; he came
in unto me to lie with me, and I cried with a loud voice:\f +  \ft loud: Heb.
great\f* 
\v 15  And it came to pass, when he heard that I lifted up my voice
and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled, and got him
out. 
\v 16  And she laid up his garment by her, until his lord came home.
\v 17  And she spake unto him according to these words, saying, The
Hebrew servant, which thou hast brought unto us, came in unto me to
mock me: 
\v 18  And it came to pass, as I lifted up my voice and cried, that he
left his garment with me, and fled out. 
\p
\v 19  And it came to pass, when his master heard the words of his
wife, which she spake unto him, saying, After this manner did thy
servant to me; that his wrath was kindled. 
\v 20  And Joseph’s master took him, and put him into the prison,
a place where the king’s prisoners \add were\add* bound: and he was there in the
prison. 
\p
\v 21 ¶ But the \nd LORD\nd* was with Joseph, and shewed him mercy,
and gave him favour in the sight of the keeper of the prison.\f + 
\ft shewed…: Heb. extended kindness unto him\f* 
\v 22  And the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph’s hand all the
prisoners that \add were\add* in the prison; and whatsoever they
did there, he was the doer \add of it\add*. 
\v 23  The keeper of the prison looked not to any thing \add that
was\add* under his hand; because the \nd LORD\nd* was with him, and
\add that\add* which he did, the \nd LORD\nd* made \add it\add* to
prosper. 
\c 40  
\p
\v 1  And it came to pass after these things, \add that\add* the
butler of the king of Egypt and \add his\add* baker had offended
their lord the king of Egypt. 
\v 2  And Pharaoh was wroth against two \add of\add* his officers,
against the chief of the butlers, and against the chief of the bakers.
\v 3  And he put them in ward in the house of the captain of the
guard, into the prison, the place where Joseph \add was\add* bound.
\v 4  And the captain of the guard charged Joseph with them, and he
served them: and they continued a season in ward. 
\p
\v 5 ¶ And they dreamed a dream both of them, each man his dream
in one night, each man according to the interpretation of his dream,
the butler and the baker of the king of Egypt, which \add were\add*
bound in the prison. 
\v 6  And Joseph came in unto them in the morning, and looked upon them, and, behold, they
\add were\add* sad. 
\v 7  And he asked Pharaoh’s officers that \add were\add* with him in the
ward of his lord’s house, saying, Wherefore look ye \add so\add*
sadly to day?\f +  \ft look…: Heb. are your faces evil?\f* 
\v 8  And they said unto him, We have dreamed a dream, and \add there
is\add* no interpreter of it. And Joseph said unto them, \add Do\add*
not interpretations \add belong\add* to God? tell me \add them\add*, I pray you.
\v 9  And the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, In my
dream, behold, a vine \add was\add* before me; 
\v 10  And in the vine \add were\add* three branches: and it \add was\add*
as though it budded, \add and\add* her blossoms shot forth; and the
clusters thereof brought forth ripe grapes: 
\v 11  And Pharaoh’s cup \add was\add* in my hand: and I took the
grapes, and pressed them into Pharaoh’s cup, and I gave the cup into
Pharaoh’s hand. 
\v 12  And Joseph said unto him, This \add is\add* the interpretation
of it: The three branches \add are\add* three days: 
\v 13  Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thine head, and
restore thee unto thy place: and thou shalt deliver Pharaoh’s cup
into his hand, after the former manner when thou wast his butler.\f + 
\ft lift…: or, reckon\f* 
\v 14  But think on me when it shall be well with thee, and shew
kindness, I pray thee, unto me, and make mention of me unto Pharaoh,
and bring me out of this house:\f +  \ft think…: Heb. remember me with
thee\f* 
\v 15  For indeed I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews:
and here also have I done nothing that they should put me into the
dungeon. 
\v 16  When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good,
he said unto Joseph, I also \add was\add* in my dream, and, behold,
\add I had\add* three white baskets on my head:\f +  \ft white: or, full of
holes\f* 
\v 17  And in the uppermost basket \add there was\add* of all manner
of bakemeats for Pharaoh; and the birds did eat them out of the basket
upon my head.\f +  \ft bakemeats…: Heb. meat of Pharaoh, the work of a baker, or,
cook\f* 
\v 18  And Joseph answered and said, This \add is\add* the interpretation
thereof: The three baskets \add are\add* three days: 
\v 19  Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee, and shall
hang thee on a tree; and the birds shall eat thy flesh from off thee.\f + 
\ft lift…: or, reckon thee, and take thy office from thee\f* 
\p
\v 20 ¶ And it came to pass the third day, \add which was\add* Pharaoh’s
birthday, that he made a feast unto all his servants: and he lifted
up the head of the chief butler and of the chief baker among his
servants.\f +  \ft lifted…: or, reckoned\f* 
\v 21  And he restored the chief butler unto his butlership again;
and he gave the cup into Pharaoh’s hand: 
\v 22  But he hanged the chief baker: as Joseph had interpreted to them.
\v 23  Yet did not the chief butler  remember Joseph, but forgat him.
\c 41  
\p
\v 1  And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh
dreamed: and, behold, he stood by the river. 
\v 2  And, behold, there came up out of the river seven well favoured
kine and fatfleshed; and they fed in a meadow. 
\v 3  And, behold, seven other kine came up after them out of the
river, ill favoured and leanfleshed; and stood by the \add other\add*
kine upon the brink of the river. 
\v 4  And the ill favoured and leanfleshed kine did eat up the seven
well favoured and fat kine. So Pharaoh awoke. 
\v 5  And he slept and dreamed the second time: and, behold, seven
ears of corn came up upon one stalk, rank and good.\f +  \ft rank: Heb.
fat\f* 
\v 6  And, behold, seven thin ears and blasted with the east wind
sprung up after them. 
\v 7  And the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full ears.
And Pharaoh awoke, and, behold, \add it was\add* a dream. 
\v 8  And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled;
and he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt, and all the wise
men thereof: and Pharaoh told them his dream; but \add there was\add*
none that could interpret them unto Pharaoh. 
\p
\v 9 ¶ Then spake the chief butler unto Pharaoh, saying, I do remember
my faults this day: 
\v 10  Pharaoh was wroth with his servants, and put me in ward in the
captain of the guard’s house, \add both\add* me and the chief baker:
\v 11  And we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he; we dreamed
each man according to the interpretation of his dream. 
\v 12 And \add there was\add* there with us a young man, an Hebrew,
servant to the captain of the guard; and we told him, and he interpreted
to us our dreams; to each man according to his dream he did interpret.
\v 13  And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was; me he
restored unto mine office, and him he hanged. 
\p
\v 14 ¶ Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him
hastily out of the dungeon: and he shaved \add himself\add*, and
changed his raiment, and came in unto Pharaoh.\f +  \ft brought…: Heb. made him
run\f* 
\v 15  And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and
\add there is\add* none that can interpret it: and I have heard say of thee,
\add that\add* thou canst understand a dream to interpret it.\f + 
\ft thou…: or, when thou hearest a dream thou canst interpret it\f*
\v 16  And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, \add It is\add* not in
me: God shall give Pharaoh an answer of peace. 
\p
\v 17  And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, In my dream, behold, I stood
upon the bank of the river: 
\v 18  And, behold, there came up out of the river seven kine, fatfleshed
and well favoured; and they fed in a meadow: 
\v 19  And, behold, seven other kine came up after them, poor and
very ill favoured and leanfleshed, such as I never saw in all the
land of Egypt for badness: 
\v 20  And the lean and the ill favoured kine did eat up the first
seven fat kine: 
\v 21  And when they had eaten them up, it could not be known that they had eaten
them; but they \add were\add* still ill favoured, as at the beginning.
So I awoke.\f +  \ft eaten…: Heb. come to the inward parts of them\f*
\v 22  And I saw in my dream, and, behold, seven ears came up in
one stalk, full and good: 
\v 23  And, behold, seven ears, withered, thin, \add and\add* blasted
with the east wind, sprung up after them:\f +  \ft withered: or,
small\f* 
\v 24  And the thin ears devoured the seven good ears: and I told
\add this\add* unto the magicians; but \add there was\add* none that could
declare \add it\add* to me. 
\p
\v 25 ¶ And Joseph said unto Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh \add is\add*
one: God hath shewed Pharaoh what he \add is\add* about to do. 
\v 26  The seven good kine \add are\add* seven years; and the seven
good ears \add are\add* seven years: the dream \add is\add* one.
\v 27  And the seven thin and ill favoured kine that came up after
them \add are\add* seven years; and the seven empty ears blasted
with the east wind shall be seven years of famine. 
\v 28 This \add is\add* the thing which I have spoken unto Pharaoh:
What God \add is\add* about to do he sheweth unto Pharaoh. 
\v 29  Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the
land of Egypt: 
\v 30  And there shall arise after them seven years of famine; and all the
plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and the famine shall
consume the land; 
\v 31  And the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that
famine following; for it \add shall be\add* very grievous.\f +  \ft grievous: Heb.
heavy\f* 
\v 32  And for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice; \add it
is\add* because the thing \add is\add* established by God, and God
will shortly bring it to pass.\f +  \ft established…: or, prepared of
God\f* 
\p
\v 33  Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise,
and set him over the land of Egypt. 
\v 34  Let Pharaoh do \add this\add*, and let him appoint officers
over the land, and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the
seven plenteous years.\f +  \ft officers: or, overseers\f* 
\v 35  And let them gather all the food of those good years that
come, and lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh, and let them keep
food in the cities. 
\v 36  And that food shall be for store to the land against the seven
years of famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt; that the land
perish not through the famine.\f +  \ft perish…: Heb. be not cut
off\f* 
\p
\v 37 ¶ And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the
eyes of all his servants. 
\v 38  And Pharaoh said unto his servants, Can we find \add such a
one\add* as this \add is\add*, a man in whom the Spirit of God \add is\add*?
\v 39  And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Forasmuch as God hath shewed thee all this,
\add there is\add* none so discreet and wise as thou \add art:\add*
\v 40  Thou shalt be over my house, and according unto thy word shall all my
people be ruled: only in the throne will I be greater than thou.\f + 
\ft be ruled: Heb. be armed, or, kiss\f* 
\v 41  And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, See, I have set thee over all the
land of Egypt. 
\v 42  And Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand, and put it upon
Joseph’s hand, and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen, and put
a gold chain about his neck;\f +  \ft fine…: or, silk\f* 
\v 43  And he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had; and they
cried before him, Bow the knee: and he made him \add ruler\add* over all the
land of Egypt.\f +  \ft Bow…: or, Tender father: Heb. Abrech\f* 
\v 44  And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I \add am\add* Pharaoh, and
without thee shall no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land
of Egypt. 
\v 45  And Pharaoh called Joseph’s name Zaphnath-paaneah; and he
gave him to wife Asenath the daughter of Poti-pherah priest of On.
And Joseph went out over \add all\add* the land of Egypt.\f +  \ft Zaphnath-paaneah: which in the Coptic signifies, A revealer
of secrets, or, The man to whom secrets are revealed\f*\f +  \ft priest: or,
prince\f* 
\p
\v 46 ¶ And Joseph \add was\add* thirty years old when he stood before
Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh,
and went throughout all the land of Egypt. 
\v 47  And in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by
handfuls. 
\v 48  And he gathered up all the food of the seven years, which were in the
land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities: the food of the
field, which \add was\add* round about every city, laid he up in the
same. 
\v 49  And Joseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea, very much,
until he left numbering; for \add it was\add* without number. 
\v 50  And unto Joseph were born two sons before the years of famine
came, which Asenath the daughter of Poti-pherah priest of On bare unto
him.\f +  \ft priest: or, prince\f* 
\v 51  And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh: For
God, \add said he\add*, hath made me forget all my toil, and all my
father’s house.\f +  \ft Manasseh: that is, Forgetting\f* 
\v 52  And the name of the second called he Ephraim: For God hath caused me to be
fruitful in the land of my affliction.\f +  \ft Ephraim: that is,
Fruitful\f* 
\p
\v 53 ¶ And the seven years of plenteousness, that was in the land
of Egypt, were ended. 
\v 54  And the seven years of dearth began to come, according as
Joseph had said: and the dearth was in all lands; but in all the
land of Egypt there was bread. 
\v 55  And when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried
to Pharaoh for bread: and Pharaoh said unto all the Egyptians, Go
unto Joseph; what he saith to you, do. 
\v 56  And the famine was over all the face of the earth: and Joseph
opened all the storehouses, and sold unto the Egyptians; and the
famine waxed sore in the land of Egypt.\f +  \ft all the storehouses: Heb. all wherein
was\f* 
\v 57  And all countries came into Egypt to Joseph for to buy \add corn;\add*
because that the famine was \add so\add* sore in all lands. 
\c 42  
\p
\v 1  Now when Jacob saw that there was corn in Egypt, Jacob said
unto his sons, Why do ye look one upon another? 
\v 2  And he said, Behold, I have heard that there is corn in Egypt:
get you down thither, and buy for us from thence; that we may live,
and not die. 
\p
\v 3 ¶ And Joseph’s ten brethren went down to buy corn in Egypt.
\v 4  But Benjamin, Joseph’s brother, Jacob sent not with his brethren;
for he said, Lest peradventure mischief befall him. 
\v 5  And the sons of Israel came to buy \add corn\add* among those that
came: for the famine was in the land of Canaan. 
\v 6  And Joseph \add was\add* the governor over the land, \add and\add* he
\add it was\add* that sold to all the people of the land: and Joseph’s
brethren came, and bowed down themselves before him \add with\add*
their faces to the earth. 
\p
\v 7  And Joseph saw his brethren, and he knew them, but made himself
strange unto them, and spake roughly unto them; and he said unto them,
Whence come ye? And they said, From the land of Canaan to buy food.\f + 
\ft roughly…: Heb. hard things with them\f* 
\v 8  And Joseph knew his brethren, but they knew not him. 
\v 9  And Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them, and
said unto them, Ye \add are\add* spies; to see the nakedness of the
land ye are come. 
\v 10  And they said unto him, Nay, my lord, but to buy food are thy
servants come. 
\v 11  We \add are\add* all one man’s sons; we \add are\add* true
\add men\add*, thy servants are no spies. 
\v 12  And he said unto them, Nay, but to see the nakedness of the
land ye are come. 
\v 13  And they said, Thy servants \add are\add* twelve brethren,
the sons of one man in the land of Canaan; and, behold, the youngest
\add is\add* this day with our father, and one \add is\add* not.
\v 14  And Joseph said unto them, That \add is it\add* that I spake
unto you, saying, Ye \add are\add* spies: 
\v 15  Hereby ye shall be proved: By the life of Pharaoh ye shall not go
forth hence, except your youngest brother come hither. 
\v 16  Send one of you, and let him fetch your brother, and ye shall be kept in
prison, that your words may be proved, whether \add there be any\add*
truth in you: or else by the life of Pharaoh surely ye \add are\add*
spies.\f +  \ft kept…: Heb. bound\f* 
\v 17  And he put them all together into ward three days.\f +  \ft put: Heb.
gathered\f* 
\v 18  And Joseph said unto them the third day, This do, and live;
\add for\add* I fear God: 
\v 19 If ye \add be\add* true \add men\add*, let one of your brethren
be bound in the house of your prison: go ye, carry corn for the famine
of your houses: 
\v 20  But bring your youngest brother unto me; so shall your words
be verified, and ye shall not die. And they did so. 
\p
\v 21 ¶ And they said one to another, We \add are\add* verily guilty
concerning our brother, in that we saw the anguish of his soul, when he
besought us, and we would not hear; therefore is this distress come upon us.
\v 22  And Reuben answered them, saying, Spake I not unto you, saying,
Do not sin against the child; and ye would not hear? therefore, behold, also his
blood is required. 
\v 23  And they knew not that Joseph understood  \add them;\add*
for he spake unto them by an interpreter.\f +  \ft he spake…: Heb. an interpreter was between
them\f* 
\v 24  And he turned himself about from them, and wept; and returned to them
again, and communed with them, and took from them Simeon, and bound
him before their eyes. 
\p
\v 25 ¶ Then Joseph commanded to fill their sacks with corn, and to
restore every man’s money into his sack, and to give them provision
for the way: and thus did he unto them. 
\v 26  And they laded their asses with the corn, and departed thence.
\v 27  And as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender
in the inn, he espied his money; for, behold, it \add was\add* in his
sack’s mouth. 
\v 28  And he said unto his brethren, My money is restored; and,
lo, \add it is\add* even in my sack: and their heart failed \add them\add*,
and they were afraid, saying one to another, What \add is\add* this
\add that\add* God hath done unto us?\f +  \ft failed…: Heb. went
forth\f* 
\p
\v 29 ¶ And they came unto Jacob their father unto the land of Canaan,
and told him all that befell unto them; saying, 
\v 30  The man, \add who is\add* the lord of the land, spake roughly
to us, and took us for spies of the country.\f +  \ft roughly…: Heb. with us hard
things\f* 
\v 31  And we said unto him, We \add are\add* true \add men;\add*
we are no spies: 
\v 32 We \add be\add* twelve brethren, sons of our father; one \add is\add*
not, and the youngest \add is\add* this day with our father in the
land of Canaan. 
\v 33  And the man, the lord of the country, said unto us, Hereby shall I
know that ye \add are\add* true \add men;\add* leave one of your
brethren \add here\add* with me, and take \add food for\add* the
famine of your households, and be gone: 
\v 34  And bring your youngest brother unto me: then shall I know that ye
\add are\add* no spies, but \add that\add* ye \add are\add* true
\add men: so\add* will I deliver you your brother, and ye shall traffick
in the land. 
\p
\v 35 ¶ And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that, behold, every
man’s bundle of money \add was\add* in his sack: and when \add both\add*
they and their father saw the bundles of money, they were afraid.
\v 36  And Jacob their father said unto them, Me have ye bereaved
\add of my children:\add* Joseph \add is\add* not, and Simeon \add is\add*
not, and ye will take Benjamin \add away:\add* all these things are against me.
\v 37  And Reuben spake unto his father, saying, Slay my two sons,
if I bring him not to thee: deliver him into my hand, and I will bring him to thee
again. 
\v 38  And he said, My son shall not go down with you; for his brother
is dead, and he is left alone: if mischief befall him by the way
in the which ye go, then shall ye bring down my gray hairs with sorrow
to the grave. 
\c 43  
\p
\v 1  And the famine \add was\add* sore in the land. 
\v 2  And it came to pass, when they had eaten up the corn which they had brought
out of Egypt, their father said unto them, Go again, buy us a little
food. 
\v 3  And Judah spake unto him, saying, The man did solemnly protest
unto us, saying, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother \add be\add* with
you.\f +  \ft did…: Heb. protesting protested\f* 
\v 4  If thou wilt send our brother with us, we will go down and
buy thee food: 
\v 5  But if thou wilt not send \add him\add*, we will not go down:
for the man said unto us, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother
\add be\add* with you. 
\v 6  And Israel said, Wherefore dealt ye \add so\add* ill with me,
\add as\add* to tell the man whether ye had yet a brother? 
\v 7  And they said, The man asked us straitly of our state, and of our
kindred, saying, \add Is\add* your father yet alive? have ye \add another\add*
brother? and we told him according to the tenor of these words: could we
certainly know that he would say, Bring your brother down?\f +  \ft asked…: Heb. asking asked
us\f*\f +  \ft tenor: Heb. mouth\f*\f +  \ft could…: Heb. knowing could we
know\f* 
\v 8  And Judah said unto Israel his father, Send the lad with me, and we will
arise and go; that we may live, and not die, both we, and thou, \add and\add*
also our little ones. 
\v 9  I will be surety for him; of my hand shalt thou require him:
if I bring him not unto thee, and set him before thee, then let me bear the
blame for ever: 
\v 10  For except we had lingered, surely now we had returned this second
time.\f +  \ft this: or, twice by this\f* 
\p
\v 11  And their father Israel said unto them, If \add it must be\add*
so now, do this; take of the best fruits in the land in your vessels,
and carry down the man a present, a little balm, and a little honey,
spices, and myrrh, nuts, and almonds: 
\v 12  And take double money in your hand; and the money that was brought
again in the mouth of your sacks, carry \add it\add* again in your
hand; peradventure it \add was\add* an oversight: 
\v 13  Take also your brother, and arise, go again unto the man:
\v 14  And God Almighty give you mercy before the man, that he may send
away your other brother, and Benjamin. If I be bereaved \add of my
children\add*, I am bereaved.\f +  \ft If…: or, And I, as I have been,
etc.\f* 
\p
\v 15 ¶ And the men took that present, and they took double money
in their hand, and Benjamin; and rose up, and went down to Egypt,
and stood before Joseph. 
\v 16  And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the ruler of his
house, Bring \add these\add* men home, and slay, and make ready; for
\add these\add* men shall dine with me at noon.\f +  \ft slay: Heb. kill a
killing\f*\f +  \ft dine: Heb. eat\f* 
\v 17  And the man did as Joseph bade; and the man brought the men
into Joseph’s house. 
\v 18  And the men were afraid, because they were brought into Joseph’s
house; and they said, Because of the money that was returned in our
sacks at the first time are we brought in; that he may seek occasion
against us, and fall upon us, and take us for bondmen, and our asses.\f + 
\ft seek…: Heb. roll himself upon us\f* 
\v 19  And they came near to the steward of Joseph’s house, and they
communed with him at the door of the house, 
\v 20  And said, O sir, we came indeed down at the first time to
buy food:\f +  \ft we…: Heb. coming down we came down\f* 
\v 21  And it came to pass, when we came to the inn, that we opened
our sacks, and, behold, \add every\add* man’s money \add was\add*
in the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight: and we have brought it
again in our hand. 
\v 22  And other money have we brought down in our hands to buy food:
we cannot tell who put our money in our sacks. 
\v 23  And he said, Peace \add be\add* to you, fear not: your God,
and the God of your father, hath given you treasure in your sacks:
I had your money. And he brought Simeon out unto them.\f +  \ft I had…: Heb. your money came to
me\f* 
\v 24  And the man brought the men into Joseph’s house, and gave
\add them\add* water, and they washed their feet; and he gave their
asses provender. 
\v 25  And they made ready the present against Joseph came at noon:
for they heard that they should eat bread there. 
\p
\v 26 ¶ And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present which
\add was\add* in their hand into the house, and bowed themselves to him to the
earth. 
\v 27  And he asked them of \add their\add* welfare, and said, \add Is\add*
your father well, the old man of whom ye spake? \add Is\add* he yet
alive?\f +  \ft welfare: Heb. peace\f*\f +  \ft Is your…: Heb. Is there peace to your
father?\f* 
\v 28  And they answered, Thy servant our father \add is\add* in good
health, he \add is\add* yet alive. And they bowed down their heads,
and made obeisance. 
\v 29  And he lifted up his eyes, and saw his brother Benjamin, his
mother’s son, and said, \add Is\add* this your younger brother, of whom ye
spake unto me? And he said, God be gracious unto thee, my son. 
\v 30  And Joseph made haste; for his bowels did yearn upon his brother:
and he sought \add where\add* to weep; and he entered into \add his\add*
chamber, and wept there. 
\v 31  And he washed his face, and went out, and refrained himself, and
said, Set on bread. 
\v 32  And they set on for him by himself, and for them by themselves, and for the
Egyptians, which did eat with him, by themselves: because the Egyptians
might not eat bread with the Hebrews; for that \add is\add* an abomination
unto the Egyptians. 
\v 33  And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright,
and the youngest according to his youth: and the men marvelled  one
at another. 
\v 34  And he took \add and sent\add* messes unto them from before
him: but Benjamin’s mess was five times so much as any of theirs. And they
drank, and were merry with him.\f +  \ft were…: Heb. drank largely\f*
\c 44  
\p
\v 1  And he commanded the steward of his house, saying, Fill the
men’s sacks \add with\add* food, as much as they can carry, and put
every man’s money in his sack’s mouth.\f +  \ft the steward…: Heb. him that was over his
house\f* 
\v 2  And put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack’s mouth of the
youngest, and his corn money. And he did according to the word that
Joseph had spoken. 
\v 3  As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they and their
asses. 
\v 4  \add And\add* when they were gone out of the city, \add and\add* not
\add yet\add* far off, Joseph said unto his steward, Up, follow after
the men; and when thou dost overtake them, say unto them, Wherefore have ye
rewarded evil for good? 
\v 5  \add Is\add* not this \add it\add* in which my lord drinketh,
and whereby indeed he divineth? ye have done evil in so doing.\f + 
\ft divineth: or, maketh trial?\f* 
\p
\v 6 ¶ And he overtook them, and he spake unto them these same words.
\v 7  And they said unto him, Wherefore saith my lord these words?
God forbid that thy servants should do according to this thing: 
\v 8  Behold, the money, which we found in our sacks’ mouths, we brought
again unto thee out of the land of Canaan: how then should we steal
out of thy lord’s house silver or gold? 
\v 9  With whomsoever of thy servants it be found, both let him die,
and we also will be my lord’s bondmen. 
\v 10  And he said, Now also \add let\add* it \add be\add* according unto your
words: he with whom it is found shall be my servant; and ye shall be
blameless. 
\v 11  Then they speedily took down every man his sack to the ground,
and opened every man his sack. 
\v 12  And he searched, \add and\add* began at the eldest, and left
at the youngest: and the cup was found in Benjamin’s sack. 
\v 13  Then they rent their clothes, and laded every man his ass,
and returned to the city. 
\p
\v 14 ¶ And Judah and his brethren came to Joseph’s house; for he
\add was\add* yet there: and they fell before him on the ground.
\v 15  And Joseph said unto them, What deed \add is\add* this that ye have
done? wot ye not that such a man as I can certainly divine?\f + 
\ft divine: or, make trial?\f* 
\v 16  And Judah said, What shall we say unto my lord? what shall we
speak? or how shall we clear ourselves? God hath found out the iniquity
of thy servants: behold, we \add are\add* my lord’s servants, both we, and
\add he\add* also with whom the cup is found. 
\v 17  And he said, God forbid that I should do so: \add but\add*
the man in whose hand the cup is found, he shall be my servant; and as for you, get you
up in peace unto your father. 
\p
\v 18 ¶ Then Judah came near unto him, and said, Oh my lord, let thy
servant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord’s ears, and let not thine
anger burn against thy servant: for thou \add art\add* even as Pharaoh.
\v 19  My lord asked his servants, saying, Have ye a father, or a
brother? 
\v 20  And we said unto my lord, We have a father, an old man, and a
child of his old age, a little one; and his brother is dead, and he alone is
left of his mother, and his father loveth him. 
\v 21  And thou saidst unto thy servants, Bring him down unto me, that I may
set mine eyes upon him. 
\v 22  And we said unto my lord, The lad cannot leave his father: for
\add if\add* he should leave his father, \add his father\add* would
die. 
\v 23  And thou saidst unto thy servants, Except your youngest brother
come down with you, ye shall see my face no more. 
\v 24  And it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my father,
we told him the words of my lord. 
\v 25  And our father said, Go again, \add and\add* buy us a little
food. 
\v 26  And we said, We cannot go down: if our youngest brother be
with us, then will we go down: for we may not see the man’s face,
except our youngest brother \add be\add* with us. 
\v 27  And thy servant my father said unto us, Ye know that my wife
bare me two \add sons:\add* 
\v 28  And the one went out from me, and I said, Surely he is torn in
pieces; and I saw him not since: 
\v 29  And if ye take this also from me, and mischief befall him,
ye shall bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave. 
\v 30  Now therefore when I come to thy servant my father, and the
lad \add be\add* not with us; seeing that his life is bound up in the lad’s
life; 
\v 31  It shall come to pass, when he seeth that the lad \add is\add* not
\add with us\add*, that he will die: and thy servants shall bring
down the gray hairs of thy servant our father with sorrow to the
grave. 
\v 32  For thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father,
saying, If I bring him not unto thee, then I shall bear the blame
to my father for ever. 
\v 33  Now therefore, I pray thee, let thy servant abide instead of the
lad a bondman to my lord; and let the lad go up with his brethren.
\v 34  For how shall I go up to my father, and the lad \add be\add*
not with me? lest peradventure I see the evil that shall come on
my father.\f +  \ft come…: Heb. find my father\f* 
\c 45  
\p
\v 1  Then Joseph could not refrain himself before all them that
stood by him; and he cried, Cause every man to go out from me. And there
stood no man with him, while Joseph made himself known unto his brethren.
\v 2  And he wept aloud: and the Egyptians and the house of Pharaoh
heard.\f +  \ft wept…: Heb. gave forth his voice in weeping\f* 
\v 3  And Joseph said unto his brethren, I \add am\add* Joseph; doth my
father yet live? And his brethren could not answer him; for they were
troubled at his presence.\f +  \ft troubled: or, terrified\f* 
\v 4  And Joseph said unto his brethren, Come near to me, I pray you. And they came
near. And he said, I \add am\add* Joseph your brother, whom ye sold
into Egypt. 
\v 5  Now therefore be not grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that ye
sold me hither: for God did send me before you to preserve life.\f + 
\ft nor…: Heb. neither let there be anger in your eyes\f* 
\v 6  For these two years \add hath\add* the famine \add been\add*
in the land: and yet \add there are\add* five years, in the which
\add there shall\add* neither \add be\add* earing nor harvest. 
\v 7  And God sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in the
earth, and to save your lives by a great deliverance.\f +  \ft to preserve…: Heb. to put for you a
remnant\f* 
\v 8 So now \add it was\add* not you \add that\add* sent me hither, but
God: and he hath made me a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his
house, and a ruler throughout all the land of Egypt. 
\v 9  Haste ye, and go up to my father, and say unto him, Thus saith
thy son Joseph, God hath made me lord of all Egypt: come down unto me,
tarry not: 
\v 10  And thou shalt dwell in the land of Goshen, and thou shalt be
near unto me, thou, and thy children, and thy children’s children,
and thy flocks, and thy herds, and all that thou hast: 
\v 11  And there will I nourish thee; for yet \add there are\add*
five years of famine; lest thou, and thy household, and all that thou hast, come to
poverty. 
\v 12  And, behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin, that
\add it is\add* my mouth that speaketh unto you. 
\v 13  And ye shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt, and of all that ye have
seen; and ye shall haste and bring down my father hither. 
\v 14  And he fell upon his brother Benjamin’s neck, and wept; and
Benjamin wept upon his neck. 
\v 15  Moreover he kissed all his brethren, and wept upon them: and
after that his brethren talked with him. 
\p
\v 16 ¶ And the fame thereof was heard in Pharaoh’s house, saying,
Joseph’s brethren are come: and it pleased Pharaoh well, and his
servants.\f +  \ft pleased…: Heb. was good in the eyes of Pharaoh\f*
\v 17  And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Say unto thy brethren, This
do ye; lade your beasts, and go, get you unto the land of Canaan;
\v 18  And take your father and your households, and come unto me: and I will
give you the good of the land of Egypt, and ye shall eat the fat
of the land. 
\v 19  Now thou art commanded, this do ye; take you wagons out of the
land of Egypt for your little ones, and for your wives, and bring
your father, and come. 
\v 20  Also regard not your stuff; for the good of all the land of
Egypt \add is\add* yours.\f +  \ft regard…: Heb. let not your eye spare,
etc.\f* 
\v 21  And the children of Israel did so: and Joseph gave them wagons,
according to the commandment of Pharaoh, and gave them provision
for the way.\f +  \ft commandment: Heb. mouth\f* 
\v 22  To all of them he gave each man changes of raiment; but to
Benjamin he gave three hundred \add pieces\add* of silver, and five
changes of raiment. 
\v 23  And to his father he sent after this \add manner;\add* ten
asses laden with the good things of Egypt, and ten she asses laden
with corn and bread and meat for his father by the way.\f +  \ft laden…: Heb.

\v 24  So he sent his brethren away, and they departed: and he said
unto them, See that ye fall not out by the way. 
\p
\v 25 ¶ And they went up out of Egypt, and came into the land of
Canaan unto Jacob their father, 
\v 26  And told him, saying, Joseph \add is\add* yet alive, and he
\add is\add* governor over all the land of Egypt. And Jacob’s heart
fainted, for he believed them not.\f +  \ft Jacob’s: Heb. his\f*
\v 27  And they told him all the words of Joseph, which he had said
unto them: and when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry
him, the spirit of Jacob their father revived: 
\v 28  And Israel said, \add It is\add* enough; Joseph my son \add is\add*
yet alive: I will go and see him before I die. 
\c 46  
\p
\v 1  And Israel took his journey with all that he had, and came
to Beer-sheba, and offered sacrifices unto the God of his father
Isaac. 
\v 2  And God spake unto Israel in the visions of the night, and
said, Jacob, Jacob. And he said, Here \add am\add* I. 
\v 3  And he said, I \add am\add* God, the God of thy father: fear
not to go down into Egypt; for I will there make of thee a great
nation: 
\v 4  I will go down with thee into Egypt; and I will also surely
bring thee up \add again:\add* and Joseph shall put his hand upon thine
eyes. 
\p
\v 5  And Jacob rose up from Beer-sheba: and the sons of Israel carried
Jacob their father, and their little ones, and their wives, in the
wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him. 
\v 6  And they took their cattle, and their goods, which they had
gotten in the land of Canaan, and came into Egypt, Jacob, and all his
seed with him: 
\v 7  His sons, and his sons’ sons with him, his daughters, and his
sons’ daughters, and all his seed brought he with him into Egypt.

\v 31  And Joseph said unto his brethren, and unto his father’s house,
I will go up, and shew Pharaoh, and say unto him, My brethren, and my
father’s house, which \add were\add* in the land of Canaan, are come unto me;
\v 32  And the men \add are\add* shepherds, for their trade hath been to feed
cattle; and they have brought their flocks, and their herds, and all that they
have.\f +  \ft their trade…: Heb. they are men of cattle\f* 
\v 33  And it shall come to pass, when Pharaoh shall call you, and shall
say, What \add is\add* your occupation? 
\v 34  That ye shall say, Thy servants’ trade hath been about cattle
from our youth even until now, both we, \add and\add* also our fathers:
that ye may dwell in the land of Goshen; for every shepherd \add is\add*
an abomination unto the Egyptians. 
\c 47  
\p
\v 1  Then Joseph came and told Pharaoh, and said, My father and my
brethren, and their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have, are come
out of the land of Canaan; and, behold, they \add are\add* in the
land of Goshen. 
\v 2  And he took some of his brethren, \add even\add* five men,
and presented them unto Pharaoh. 
\v 3  And Pharaoh said unto his brethren, What \add is\add* your
occupation? And they said unto Pharaoh, Thy servants \add are\add*
shepherds, both we, \add and\add* also our fathers. 
\v 4  They said moreover unto Pharaoh, For to sojourn in the land
are we come; for thy servants have no pasture for their flocks; for the
famine \add is\add* sore in the land of Canaan: now therefore, we pray thee, let thy
servants dwell in the land of Goshen. 
\v 5  And Pharaoh spake unto Joseph, saying, Thy father and thy brethren
are come unto thee: 
\v 6  The land of Egypt \add is\add* before thee; in the best of the
land make thy father and brethren to dwell; in the land of Goshen
let them dwell: and if thou knowest \add any\add* men of activity
among them, then make them rulers over my cattle. 
\v 7  And Joseph brought in Jacob his father, and set him before
Pharaoh: and Jacob blessed Pharaoh. 
\v 8  And Pharaoh said unto Jacob, How old \add art\add* thou?\f + 
\ft How…: Heb. How many are the days of the years of thy life?\f*
\v 9  And Jacob said unto Pharaoh, The days of the years of my pilgrimage
\add are\add* an hundred and thirty years: few and evil have the
days of the years of my life been, and have not attained unto the
days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their
pilgrimage. 
\v 10  And Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out from before Pharaoh.
\p
\v 11 ¶ And Joseph placed his father and his brethren, and gave them a
possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the
land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded. 
\v 12  And Joseph nourished his father, and his brethren, and all his
father’s household, with bread, according to \add their\add* families.\f + 
\ft according…: or, as a little child is nourished: Heb. according to the little
ones\f* 
\p
\v 13 ¶ And \add there was\add* no bread in all the land; for the
famine \add was\add* very sore, so that the land of Egypt and \add all\add*
the land of Canaan fainted by reason of the famine. 
\v 14  And Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the
land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the corn which they
bought: and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh’s house. 
\v 15  And when money failed in the land of Egypt, and in the land
of Canaan, all the Egyptians came unto Joseph, and said, Give us
bread: for why should we die in thy presence? for the money faileth.
\v 16  And Joseph said, Give your cattle; and I will give you for your
cattle, if money fail. 
\v 17  And they brought their cattle unto Joseph: and Joseph gave
them bread \add in exchange\add* for horses, and for the flocks,
and for the cattle of the herds, and for the asses: and he fed them with
bread for all their cattle for that year.\f +  \ft fed…: Heb. led
them\f* 
\v 18  When that year was ended, they came unto him the second year,
and said unto him, We will not hide \add it\add* from my lord, how that our
money is spent; my lord also hath our herds of cattle; there is not ought
left in the sight of my lord, but our bodies, and our lands: 
\v 19  Wherefore shall we die before thine eyes, both we and our
land? buy us and our land for bread, and we and our land will be
servants unto Pharaoh: and give \add us\add* seed, that we may live,
and not die, that the land be not desolate. 
\v 20  And Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh; for the
Egyptians sold every man his field, because the famine prevailed
over them: so the land became Pharaoh’s. 
\v 21  And as for the people, he removed them to cities from \add one\add*
end of the borders of Egypt even to the \add other\add* end thereof.
\v 22  Only the land of the priests bought he not; for the priests
had a portion \add assigned them\add* of Pharaoh, and did eat their
portion which Pharaoh gave them: wherefore they sold not their lands.\f + 
\ft priests: or, princes\f* 
\v 23  Then Joseph said unto the people, Behold, I have bought you this
day and your land for Pharaoh: lo, \add here is\add* seed for you, and ye shall
sow the land. 
\v 24  And it shall come to pass in the increase, that ye shall give
the fifth \add part\add* unto Pharaoh, and four parts shall be your own, for
seed of the field, and for your food, and for them of your households,
and for food for your little ones. 
\v 25  And they said, Thou hast saved our lives: let us find grace
in the sight of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh’s servants. 
\v 26  And Joseph made it a law over the land of Egypt unto this
day, \add that\add* Pharaoh should have the fifth \add part;\add*
except the land of the priests only, \add which\add* became not Pharaoh’s.\f + 
\ft priests: or, princes\f* 
\p
\v 27 ¶ And Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt, in the country of
Goshen; and they had possessions therein, and grew, and multiplied
exceedingly. 
\v 28  And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years: so the whole
age of Jacob was an hundred forty and seven years.\f +  \ft the whole…: Heb. the days of the years of his
life\f* 
\v 29  And the time drew nigh that Israel must die: and he called
his son Joseph, and said unto him, If now I have found grace in thy
sight, put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh, and deal kindly
and truly with me; bury me not, I pray thee, in Egypt: 
\v 30  But I will lie with my fathers, and thou shalt carry me out of
Egypt, and bury me in their buryingplace. And he said, I will do
as thou hast said. 
\v 31  And he said, Swear unto me. And he sware unto him. And Israel
bowed himself upon the bed’s head. 
\c 48  
\p
\v 1  And it came to pass after these things, that \add one\add*
told Joseph, Behold, thy father \add is\add* sick: and he took with him his
two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim. 
\v 2 And \add one\add* told Jacob, and said, Behold, thy son Joseph
cometh unto thee: and Israel strengthened  himself, and sat upon the
bed. 
\v 3  And Jacob said unto Joseph, God Almighty appeared unto me at
Luz in the land of Canaan, and blessed me, 
\v 4  And said unto me, Behold, I will make thee fruitful, and multiply
thee, and I will make of thee a multitude of people; and will give
this land to thy seed after thee \add for\add* an everlasting possession.
\p
\v 5 ¶ And now thy two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, which were born
unto thee in the land of Egypt before I came unto thee into Egypt,
\add are\add* mine; as Reuben and Simeon, they shall be mine. 
\v 6  And thy issue, which thou begettest after them, shall be thine,
\add and\add* shall be called after the name of their brethren in their
inheritance. 
\v 7  And as for me, when I came from Padan, Rachel died by me in the
land of Canaan in the way, when yet \add there was\add* but a little
way to come unto Ephrath: and I buried her there in the way of Ephrath; the same
\add is\add* Beth-lehem. 
\p
\v 8  And Israel beheld Joseph’s sons, and said, Who \add are\add* these?
\v 9  And Joseph said unto his father, They \add are\add* my sons,
whom God hath given me in this \add place\add*. And he said, Bring
them, I pray thee, unto me, and I will bless them. 
\v 10  Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, \add so that\add*
he could not see. And he brought them near unto him; and he kissed
them, and embraced them.\f +  \ft dim: Heb. heavy\f* 
\v 11  And Israel said unto Joseph, I had not thought to see thy
face: and, lo, God hath shewed me also thy seed. 
\v 12  And Joseph brought them out from between his knees, and he
bowed himself with his face to the earth. 
\v 13  And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward
Israel’s left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel’s
right hand, and brought \add them\add* near unto him. 
\v 14  And Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid \add it\add*
upon Ephraim’s head, who \add was\add* the younger, and his left
hand upon Manasseh’s head, guiding his hands wittingly; for Manasseh
\add was\add* the firstborn. 
\p
\v 15 ¶ And he blessed Joseph, and said, God, before whom my fathers
Abraham and Isaac did walk, the God which fed me all my life long
unto this day, 
\v 16  The Angel which redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads;
and let my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers Abraham
and Isaac; and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the
earth.\f +  \ft grow: Heb. as fishes do increase\f* 
\v 17  And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the
head of Ephraim, it displeased him: and he held up his father’s hand,
to remove it from Ephraim’s head unto Manasseh’s head.\f +  \ft displeased…: was evil in his
eyes\f* 
\v 18  And Joseph said unto his father, Not so, my father: for this
\add is\add* the firstborn; put thy right hand upon his head. 
\v 19  And his father refused, and said, I know \add it\add*, my
son, I know \add it:\add* he also shall become a people, and he also shall be
great: but truly his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his
seed shall become a multitude of nations.\f +  \ft multitude: Heb.
fulness\f* 
\v 20  And he blessed them that day, saying, In thee shall Israel
bless, saying, God make thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh: and he set
Ephraim before Manasseh. 
\v 21  And Israel said unto Joseph, Behold, I die: but God shall be with you, and bring you
again unto the land of your fathers. 
\v 22  Moreover I have given to thee one portion above thy brethren,
which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my
bow. 
\c 49  
\p
\v 1  And Jacob called unto his sons, and said, Gather yourselves
together, that I may tell you \add that\add* which shall befall you in the
last days. 
\v 2  Gather yourselves together, and hear, ye sons of Jacob; and
hearken unto Israel your father. 
\p
\v 3 ¶ Reuben, thou \add art\add* my firstborn, my might, and the
beginning of my strength, the excellency of dignity, and the excellency
of power: 
\v 4  Unstable as water, thou shalt not excel; because thou wentest
up to thy father’s bed; then defiledst thou \add it:\add* he went
up to my couch.\f +  \ft thou shalt…: Heb. do not thou excel\f*\f + 
\ft he went…: or, my couch is gone\f* 
\p
\v 5 ¶ Simeon and Levi \add are\add* brethren; instruments of cruelty
\add are in\add* their habitations.\f +  \ft instruments…: or, their swords are weapons of
violence\f* 
\v 6  O my soul, come not thou into their secret; unto their assembly,
mine honour, be not thou united: for in their anger they slew a man,
and in their selfwill they digged down a wall.\f +  \ft digged…: or, houghed
oxen\f* 
\v 7  Cursed \add be\add* their anger, for \add it was\add* fierce;
and their wrath, for it was cruel: I will divide them in Jacob, and
scatter them in Israel. 
\p
\v 8 ¶ Judah, thou \add art he\add* whom thy brethren shall praise:
thy hand \add shall be\add* in the neck of thine enemies; thy father’s
children shall bow down before thee. 
\v 9  Judah \add is\add* a lion’s whelp: from the prey, my son, thou art gone
up: he stooped down, he couched as a lion, and as an old lion; who shall rouse him
up? 
\v 10  The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his
feet, until Shiloh come; and unto him \add shall\add* the gathering
of the people \add be\add*. 
\v 11  Binding his foal unto the vine, and his ass’s colt unto the choice
vine; he washed his garments in wine, and his clothes in the blood
of grapes: 
\v 12  His eyes \add shall be\add* red with wine, and his teeth white
with milk. 
\p
\v 13 ¶ Zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea; and he \add shall
be\add* for an haven of ships; and his border \add shall be\add*
unto Zidon. 
\p
\v 14 ¶ Issachar \add is\add* a strong ass couching down between two
burdens: 
\v 15  And he saw that rest \add was\add* good, and the land that
\add it was\add* pleasant; and bowed his shoulder to bear, and became a
servant unto tribute. 
\p
\v 16 ¶ Dan shall judge his people, as one of the tribes of Israel.
\v 17  Dan shall be a serpent by the way, an adder in the path, that
biteth the horse heels, so that his rider shall fall backward.\f + 
\ft an adder: Heb. an arrow-snake\f* 
\v 18  I have waited for thy salvation, O \nd LORD\nd*. 
\p
\v 19 ¶ Gad, a troop shall overcome him: but he shall overcome at the
last. 
\p
\v 20 ¶ Out of Asher his bread \add shall be\add* fat, and he shall
yield royal dainties. 
\p
\v 21 ¶ Naphtali \add is\add* a hind let loose: he giveth goodly
words. 
\p
\v 22 ¶ Joseph \add is\add* a fruitful bough, \add even\add* a fruitful
bough by a well; \add whose\add* branches run over the wall:\f + 
\ft branches: Heb. daughters\f* 
\v 23  The archers have sorely grieved him, and shot \add at him\add*,
and hated him: 
\v 24  But his bow abode in strength, and the arms of his hands were made
strong by the hands of the mighty \add God\add* of Jacob; (from thence
\add is\add* the shepherd, the stone of Israel:) 
\v 25  \add Even\add* by the God of thy father, who shall help thee; and
by the Almighty, who shall bless thee with blessings of heaven above,
blessings of the deep that lieth under, blessings of the breasts,
and of the womb: 
\v 26  The blessings of thy father have prevailed above the blessings
of my progenitors unto the utmost bound of the everlasting hills:
they shall be on the head of Joseph, and on the crown of the head
of him that was separate from his brethren. 
\p
\v 27 ¶ Benjamin shall ravin \add as\add* a wolf: in the morning
he shall devour the prey, and at night he shall divide the spoil.
\p
\v 28 ¶ All these \add are\add* the twelve tribes of Israel: and this
\add is it\add* that their father spake unto them, and blessed them;
every one according to his blessing he blessed them. 
\v 29  And he charged them, and said unto them, I am to be gathered
unto my people: bury me with my fathers in the cave that \add is\add*
in the field of Ephron the Hittite, 
\v 30  In the cave that \add is\add* in the field of Machpelah, which
\add is\add* before Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought
with the field of Ephron the Hittite for a possession of a buryingplace.
\v 31  There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they buried
Isaac and Rebekah his wife; and there I buried Leah. 
\v 32  The purchase of the field and of the cave that \add is\add* therein
\add was\add* from the children of Heth. 
\v 33  And when Jacob had made an end of commanding his sons, he gathered
up his feet into the bed, and yielded up the ghost, and was gathered
unto his people. 
\c 50  
\p
\v 1  And Joseph fell upon his father’s face, and wept upon him, and
kissed him. 
\v 2  And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm
his father: and the physicians embalmed Israel. 
\v 3  And forty days were fulfilled for him; for so are fulfilled
the days of those which are embalmed: and the Egyptians mourned for him threescore and
ten days.\f +  \ft mourned: Heb. wept\f* 
\v 4  And when the days of his mourning were past, Joseph spake unto the
house of Pharaoh, saying, If now I have found grace in your eyes,
speak, I pray you, in the ears of Pharaoh, saying, 
\v 5  My father made me swear, saying, Lo, I die: in my grave which I have
digged for me in the land of Canaan, there shalt thou bury me. Now therefore let me go
up, I pray thee, and bury my father, and I will come again. 
\v 6  And Pharaoh said, Go up, and bury thy father, according as he made thee
swear. 
\p
\v 7 ¶ And Joseph went up to bury his father: and with him went up
all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all the
elders of the land of Egypt, 
\v 8  And all the house of Joseph, and his brethren, and his father’s
house: only their little ones, and their flocks, and their herds,
they left in the land of Goshen. 
\v 9  And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen: and it was a
very great company. 
\v 10  And they came to the threshingfloor of Atad, which \add is\add*
beyond Jordan, and there they mourned with a great and very sore
lamentation: and he made a mourning for his father seven days. 
\v 11  And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw
the mourning in the floor of Atad, they said, This \add is\add* a
grievous mourning to the Egyptians: wherefore the name of it was
called Abel-mizraim, which \add is\add* beyond Jordan.\f +  \ft Abel-mizraim: that is, The mourning of the
Egyptians\f* 
\v 12  And his sons did unto him according as he commanded them:
\v 13  For his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried
him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham bought with the
field for a possession of a buryingplace of Ephron the Hittite, before
Mamre. 
\p
\v 14 ¶ And Joseph returned into Egypt, he, and his brethren, and all that went
up with him to bury his father, after he had buried his father. 
\p
\v 15 ¶ And when Joseph’s brethren saw that their father was dead,
they said, Joseph will peradventure hate us, and will certainly requite
us all the evil which we did unto him. 
\v 16  And they sent a messenger unto Joseph, saying, Thy father
did command before he died, saying,\f +  \ft sent: Heb. charged\f*
\v 17  So shall ye say unto Joseph, Forgive, I pray thee now, the
trespass of thy brethren, and their sin; for they did unto thee evil:
and now, we pray thee, forgive the trespass of the servants of the
God of thy father. And Joseph wept when they spake unto him. 
\v 18  And his brethren also went and fell down before his face;
and they said, Behold, we \add be\add* thy servants. 
\v 19  And Joseph said unto them, Fear not: for \add am\add* I in the place of
God? 
\v 20  But as for you, ye thought evil against me; \add but\add*
God meant it unto good, to bring to pass, as \add it is\add* this
day, to save much people alive. 
\v 21  Now therefore fear ye not: I will nourish you, and your little
ones. And he comforted them, and spake kindly unto them.\f +  \ft kindly…: Heb. to their
hearts\f* 
\p
\v 22 ¶ And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he, and his father’s house: and
Joseph lived an hundred and ten years. 
\v 23  And Joseph saw Ephraim’s children of the third \add generation:\add*
the children also of Machir the son of Manasseh were brought up upon
Joseph’s knees.\f +  \ft brought…: Heb. born\f* 
\v 24  And Joseph said unto his brethren, I die: and God will surely
visit you, and bring you out of this land unto the land which he
sware to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob. 
\v 25  And Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel, saying,
God will surely visit you, and ye shall carry up my bones from hence.
\v 26  So Joseph died, \add being\add* an hundred and ten years old:
and they embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.
