\c 25
\d By David.
\q1
\v 1 To you, Yahweh, do I lift up my soul.
\q1
\v 2 My God, I have trusted in you.
\q2 Don’t let me be shamed.
\q2 Don’t let my enemies triumph over me.
\q1
\v 3 Yes, no one who waits for you shall be shamed.
\q2 They shall be shamed who deal treacherously without cause.
\b
\q1
\v 4 Show me your ways, Yahweh.
\q2 Teach me your paths.
\q1
\v 5 Guide me in your truth, and teach me,
\q2 For you are the God of my salvation,
\q2 I wait for you all day long.
\q1
\v 6 Yahweh, remember your tender mercies and your loving kindness,
\q2 for they are from old times.
\q1
\v 7 Don’t remember the sins of my youth, nor my transgressions.
\q2 Remember me according to your loving kindness,
\q2 for your goodness’ sake, Yahweh.
\q1
\v 8 Good and upright is Yahweh,
\q2 therefore he will instruct sinners in the way.
\q1
\v 9 He will guide the humble in justice.
\q2 He will teach the humble his way.
\q1
\v 10 All the paths of Yahweh are loving kindness and truth
\q2 to such as keep his covenant and his testimonies.
\q1
\v 11 For your name’s sake, Yahweh,
\q2 pardon my iniquity, for it is great.
\q1
\v 12 What man is he who fears Yahweh?
\q2 He shall instruct him in the way that he shall choose.
\q1
\v 13 His soul shall dwell at ease.
\q2 His offspring shall inherit the land.
\q1
\v 14 The friendship of Yahweh is with those who fear him.
\q2 He will show them his covenant.
\b
\q1
\v 15 My eyes are ever on Yahweh,
\q2 for he will pluck my feet out of the net.
\q1
\v 16 Turn to me, and have mercy on me,
\q2 for I am desolate and afflicted.
\q1
\v 17 The troubles of my heart are enlarged.
\q2 Oh bring me out of my distresses.
\q1
\v 18 Consider my affliction and my travail.
\q2 Forgive all my sins.
\q1
\v 19 Consider my enemies, for they are many.
\q2 They hate me with cruel hatred.
\q1
\v 20 Oh keep my soul, and deliver me.
\q2 Let me not be disappointed, for I take refuge in you.
\q1
\v 21 Let integrity and uprightness preserve me,
\q2 for I wait for you.
\q1
\v 22 Redeem Israel, God,
\q2 out of all his troubles.
