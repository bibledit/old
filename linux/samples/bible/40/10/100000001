\v 1 He called to himself his twelve disciples, and gave them authority over unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal every disease and every sickness.
\v 2 Now the names of the twelve apostles are these. The first, Simon, who is called Peter; Andrew, his brother; James the son of Zebedee; John, his brother;
\v 3 Philip; Bartholomew; Thomas; Matthew the tax collector; James the son of Alphaeus; Lebbaeus, who was also called\f + NU omits “Lebbaeus, who was also called”\f* Thaddaeus;
\v 4 Simon the Canaanite; and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him.
\p
\v 5 Jesus sent these twelve out, and commanded them, saying, \wj “Don’t go among the Gentiles, and don’t enter into any city of the Samaritans. \wj*
\v 6 \wj Rather, go to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. \wj*
\v 7 \wj As you go, preach, saying, ‘The Kingdom of Heaven is at hand!’\wj*
\v 8 \wj Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers,\wj*\f + TR adds “raise the dead,”\f* \wj and cast out demons. Freely you received, so freely give.\wj*
\v 9 \wj Don’t take any gold, silver, or brass in your money belts.\wj*
\v 10 \wj Take no bag for your journey, neither two coats, nor shoes, nor staff: for the laborer is worthy of his food.\wj*
\v 11 \wj Into whatever city or village you enter, find out who in it is worthy; and stay there until you go on.\wj*
\v 12 \wj As you enter into the household, greet it. \wj*
\v 13 \wj If the household is worthy, let your peace come on it, but if it isn’t worthy, let your peace return to you.\wj*
\v 14 \wj Whoever doesn’t receive you, nor hear your words, as you go out of that house or that city, shake the dust off your feet. \wj*
\v 15 \wj Most certainly I tell you, it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for that city.\wj*
\p
\v 16 \wj “Behold, I send you out as sheep among wolves. Therefore be wise as serpents, and harmless as doves.\wj*
\v 17 \wj But beware of men: for they will deliver you up to councils, and in their synagogues they will scourge you.\wj*
\v 18 \wj Yes, and you will be brought before governors and kings for my sake, for a testimony to them and to the nations.\wj*
\v 19 \wj But when they deliver you up, don’t be anxious how or what you will say, for it will be given you in that hour what you will say. \wj*
\v 20 \wj For it is not you who speak, but the Spirit of your Father who speaks in you.\wj*
\p
\v 21 \wj “Brother will deliver up brother to death, and the father his child. Children will rise up against parents, and cause them to be put to death. \wj*
\v 22 \wj You will be hated by all men for my name’s sake, but he who endures to the end will be saved.\wj*
\v 23 \wj But when they persecute you in this city, flee into the next, for most certainly I tell you, you will not have gone through the cities of Israel, until the Son of Man has come.\wj*
\p
\v 24 \wj “A disciple is not above his teacher, nor a servant above his lord.\wj*
\v 25 \wj It is enough for the disciple that he be like his teacher, and the servant like his lord. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebul,\wj*\f + Literally, Lord of the Flies, or the devil\f* \wj how much more those of his household! \wj*
\v 26 \wj Therefore don’t be afraid of them, for there is nothing covered that will not be revealed; and hidden that will not be known. \wj*
\v 27 \wj What I tell you in the darkness, speak in the light; and what you hear whispered in the ear, proclaim on the housetops. \wj*
\v 28 \wj Don’t be afraid of those who kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul. Rather, fear him who is able to destroy both soul and body in Gehenna.\wj* \f + or, Hell.\f*
\p
\v 29 \wj “Aren’t two sparrows sold for an assarion coin?\wj*\f + An assarion is a small coin worth one tenth of a drachma or a sixteenth of a denarius. An assarion is approximately the wages of one half hour of agricultural labor.\f* \wj Not one of them falls on the ground apart from your Father’s will,\wj*
\v 30 \wj but the very hairs of your head are all numbered. \wj*
\v 31 \wj Therefore don’t be afraid. You are of more value than many sparrows.\wj*
\v 32 \wj Everyone therefore who confesses me before men, I will also confess him before my Father who is in heaven.\wj*
\v 33 \wj But whoever denies me before men, I will also deny him before my Father who is in heaven.\wj*
\p
\v 34 \wj “Don’t think that I came to send peace on the earth. I didn’t come to send peace, but a sword.\wj*
\v 35 \wj For I came to set a man at odds against his father, and a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law. \wj*
\v 36 \wj A man’s foes will be those of his own household.\wj*\x +

\v 37 \wj He who loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me; and he who loves son or daughter more than me isn’t worthy of me. \wj*
\v 38 \wj He who doesn’t take his cross and follow after me, isn’t worthy of me.\wj*
\v 39 \wj He who seeks his life will lose it; and he who loses his life for my sake will find it.\wj*
\v 40 \wj He who receives you receives me, and he who receives me receives him who sent me.\wj*
\v 41 \wj He who receives a prophet in the name of a prophet will receive a prophet’s reward. He who receives a righteous man in the name of a righteous man will receive a righteous man’s reward.\wj*
\v 42 \wj Whoever gives one of these little ones just a cup of cold water to drink in the name of a disciple, most certainly I tell you he will in no way lose his reward.”\wj*
