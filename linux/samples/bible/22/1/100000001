\v 2 Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth;
\q2 for your love is better than wine.
\q1
\v 3 Your oils have a pleasing fragrance.
\q2 Your name is oil poured out,
\q2 therefore the virgins love you.
\q1
\v 4 Take me away with you.
\q2 Let’s hurry.
\q2 The king has brought me into his rooms.
\sp Friends

\q2 We will praise your love more than wine!

\v 5 I am dark, but lovely,
\q2 you daughters of Jerusalem,
\q2 like Kedar’s tents,
\q2 like Solomon’s curtains.
\q1
\v 6 Don’t stare at me because I am dark,
\q2 because the sun has scorched me.
\q1 My mother’s sons were angry with me.
\q2 They made me keeper of the vineyards.
\q2 I haven’t kept my own vineyard.
\q1
\v 7 Tell me, you whom my soul loves,
\q2 where you graze your flock,
\q2 where you rest them at noon;
\q2 For why should I be as one who is veiled
\q2 beside the flocks of your companions?
\sp Lover

\v 8 If you don’t know, most beautiful among women,
\q2 follow the tracks of the sheep.
\q2 Graze your young goats beside the shepherds’ tents.

\v 9 I have compared you, my love,
\q2 to a steed in Pharaoh’s chariots.

\v 12 While the king sat at his table,
\q2 my perfume spread its fragrance.

\v 13 My beloved is to me a sachet of myrrh,

\q2 from the vineyards of En Gedi.
